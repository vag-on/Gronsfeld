Description: add and remove users and groups
 This package includes the 'adduser' and 'deluser' commands for creating
 and removing users.
 .
  - 'adduser' creates new users and groups and adds existing users to
    existing groups;
  - 'deluser' removes users and groups and removes users from a given
    group.
 .
 Adding users with 'adduser' is much easier than adding them manually.
 Adduser will choose appropriate UID and GID values, create a home
 directory, copy skeletal user configuration, and automate setting
 initial values for the user's password, real name and so on.
 .
 Deluser can back up and remove users' home directories
 and mail spool or all the files they own on the system.
 .
 A custom script can be executed after each of the commands.

Description: Advanced Forensics Format Library (utilities)
 The Advanced Forensic Format (AFF) is on-disk format for storing
 computer forensic information. Critical features of AFF include:
 .
  - AFF allows you to store both computer forensic data and associated
    metadata in one or more files.
  - AFF allows files to be digital signed, to provide for
    chain-of-custody and long-term file integrity.
  - AFF allows for forensic disk images to stored encrypted and
    decrypted on-the-fly for processing. This allows disk images
    containing privacy sensitive material to be stored on the Internet.
 .
 This package provides the AFF Toolkit, that is a set of programs for
 working with computer forensic information. Using these tools you can:
  * Interconvert disk images between a variety of formats, including:
      - raw or "dd";
      - splitraw (in which a single image is split between multiple files);
      - AFF format (in which the entire disk image is stored in a single
        file);
      - AFD format (in which a disk image is stored in multiple AFF files
        stored in a single directory);
      - AFM format (in which an AFF file is used to annotate a raw file).
  * Compare disk images and report the data or metadata that is different.
  * Copy disk images from one location to another, with full verification
    of data, metadata, and the automatic generation of a chain-of-custody
    segment.
  * Find errors in an AFF file and fix them.
  * Print information about a file.
  * Print detailed statistics about a file
  * Generate a XML representation of a disk image's metadata (for example,
    acquisition time or the serial number of the acquisition device).
  * Produce a XML "diskprint" which allows a disk image to be rapidly
    fingerprinted without having the computer the SHA1 of the entire
    disk.
 .
 The AFF Toolkit provides these executables: affcat, affcompare, affconvert,
 affcopy, affcrypto, affdiskprint, affinfo, affix, affrecover, affsegment,
 affsign, affstats, affuse, affverify and affxml.

Description: wireless WEP/WPA cracking utilities
 aircrack-ng is an 802.11a/b/g WEP/WPA cracking program that can recover a
 40-bit, 104-bit, 256-bit or 512-bit WEP key once enough encrypted packets
 have been gathered. Also it can attack WPA1/2 networks with some advanced
 methods or simply by brute force.
 .
 It implements the standard FMS attack along with some optimizations,
 thus making the attack much faster compared to other WEP cracking tools.
 It can also fully use a multiprocessor system to its full power in order
 to speed up the cracking process.
 .
 aircrack-ng is a fork of aircrack, as that project has been stopped by
 the upstream maintainer.

Description: Automated Password Generator - Standalone version
 APG (Automated Password Generator) is the tool set for random
 password generation. It generates some random words of required type
 and prints them to standard output. This binary package contains only
 the standalone version of apg.
 Advantages:
  * Built-in ANSI X9.17 RNG (Random Number Generator)(CAST/SHA1)
  * Built-in password quality checking system (now it has support for Bloom
    filter for faster access)
  * Two Password Generation Algorithms:
     1. Pronounceable Password Generation Algorithm (according to NIST
        FIPS 181)
     2. Random Character Password Generation Algorithm with 35
        configurable modes of operation
  * Configurable password length parameters
  * Configurable amount of generated passwords
  * Ability to initialize RNG with user string
  * Support for /dev/random
  * Ability to crypt() generated passwords and print them as additional output.
  * Special parameters to use APG in script
  * Ability to log password generation requests for network version
  * Ability to control APG service access using tcpd
  * Ability to use password generation service from any type of box (Mac,
    WinXX, etc.) that connected to network
  * Ability to enforce remote users to use only allowed type of password
    generation
 The client/server version of apg has been deliberately omitted.
 .
 Please note that there are security flaws in pronounceable

 Bash is an sh-compatible command language interpreter that executes
 commands read from the standard input or from a file.  Bash also
 incorporates useful features from the Korn and C shells (ksh and csh).
 .
 Bash is ultimately intended to be a conformant implementation of the
 IEEE POSIX Shell and Tools specification (IEEE Working Group 1003.2).
 .
 The Programmable Completion Code, by Ian Macdonald, is now found in
 the bash-completion package.

Description: Browser Exploitation Framework (BeEF)
 BeEF is short for The Browser Exploitation Framework. It is a penetration
 testing tool that focuses on the web browser.
 .
 Amid growing concerns about web-born attacks against clients, including
 mobile clients, BeEF allows the professional penetration tester to assess the
 actual security posture of a target environment by using client-side attack
 vectors. Unlike other security frameworks, BeEF looks past the hardened
 network perimeter and client system, and examines exploitability within the
 context of the one open door: the web browser. BeEF will hook one or more web
 browsers and use them as beachheads for launching directed command modules and
 further attacks against the system from within the browser context.

Description: Support for extra binary formats
 The binfmt_misc kernel module, contained in versions 2.1.43 and later of the
 Linux kernel, allows system administrators to register interpreters for
 various binary formats based on a magic number or their file extension, and
 cause the appropriate interpreter to be invoked whenever a matching file is
 executed. Think of it as a more flexible version of the #! executable
 interpreter mechanism.
 .
 This package provides an 'update-binfmts' script with which package
 maintainers can register interpreters to be used with this module without
 having to worry about writing their own init.d scripts, and which sysadmins
 can use for a slightly higher-level interface to this module.

Description: Simple Bash script to locate Bluetooth devices
 BlueRanger is a simple Bash script which uses Link
 Quality to locate Bluetooth device radios. It sends
 l2cap (Bluetooth) pings to create a connection
 between Bluetooth interfaces, since most devices
 allow pings without any authentication or
 authorization. The higher the link quality, the
 closer the device (in theory).
 .
 Use a Bluetooth Class 1 adapter for long range
 location detection. Switch to a Class 3 adapter
 for more precise short range locating. The
 recision and accuracy depend on the build quality
 of the Bluetooth adapter, interference, and response
 from the remote device. Fluctuations may occur even
 when neither device is in motion.

Description: Mass SNMP scanner
 Braa is a mass snmp scanner. The intended usage of such a tool is of course
 making SNMP queries - but unlike snmpget or snmpwalk from net-snmp, it is able
 to query dozens or hundreds of hosts simultaneously, and in a single process.
 Thus, it consumes very few system resources and does the scanning VERY fast.
 .
 Braa implements its OWN snmp stack, so it does NOT need any SNMP libraries
 like net-snmp. The implementation is very dirty, supports only several data
 types, and in any case cannot be stated 'standard-conforming'! It was designed
 to be fast, and it is fast. For this reason (well, and also because of author
 laziness ;), there is no ASN.1 parser in braa - the user HAVE to know the
 numerical values of OID's
 (for instance .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0 instead of system.sysName.0).

Description: ncurses-based scanner for Bluetooth devices
 btscanner is a tool designed specifically to extract as much information
 as possible from a Bluetooth device without the requirement to pair. A
 detailed information screen extracts HCI and SDP information, and
 maintains an open connection to monitor the RSSI and link quality.
 btscanner is based on the BlueZ Bluetooth stack, which is included with
 recent Linux kernels, and the BlueZ toolset. btscanner also contains a
 complete listing of the IEEE OUI numbers and class lookup tables. Using
 the information gathered from these sources it is possible to make
 educated guesses as to the host device type.

Description: utility for unprivileged chroot and namespace manipulation
 bubblewrap uses Linux namespaces to launch unprivileged containers.
 These containers can be used to sandbox semi-trusted applications such
 as Flatpak apps, image/video thumbnailers and web browser components,
 or to run programs in a different library stack such as a Flatpak runtime
 or a different Debian release.
 .
 By default, this package relies on a kernel with user namespaces enabled.
 Official Debian and Ubuntu kernels are suitable.
 .
 On kernels without user namespaces, system administrators can make the
 bwrap executable setuid root, allowing it to create unprivileged
 containers even though ordinary user processes cannot.

Description: Informational list of build-essential packages
 If you do not plan to build Debian packages, you don't need this
 package.  Starting with dpkg (>= 1.14.18) this package is required
 for building Debian packages.
 .
 This package contains an informational list of packages which are
 considered essential for building Debian packages.  This package also
 depends on the packages on that list, to make it easy to have the
 build-essential packages installed.
 .
 If you have this package installed, you only need to install whatever
 a package specifies as its build-time dependencies to build the
 package.  Conversely, if you are determining what your package needs
 to build-depend on, you can always leave out the packages this
 package depends on.
 .
 This package is NOT the definition of what packages are
 build-essential; the real definition is in the Debian Policy Manual.
 This package contains merely an informational list, which is all
 most people need.   However, if this package and the manual disagree,
 the manual is correct.

 their full-featured GNU cousins; however, the options that are included
 provide the expected functionality and behave very much like their GNU
 counterparts.
 .
 This package installs the BusyBox binary but does not install
 symlinks for any of the supported utilities. Some of the utilities
 can be used in the system by installing the busybox-syslogd,

 words which can then be used for password crackers such as John
 the Ripper. Optionally, CeWL can follow  external links.
 .
 CeWL can also create a list of email addresses found in mailto
 links. These email addresses can be used as usernames in brute
 force actions.
 .
 Another tool provided by CeWL project is FAB (Files Already
 Bagged). FAB extracts the content of the author/creator fields,
 from metadata of the some files, to create lists of possible
 usernames. These usernames can be used in association with the
 password list generated by CeWL. FAB uses the same metadata
 extraction techniques that CeWL. Currently, FAB process Office
 pre 2007, Office 2007 and PDF formats.
 .
 CeWL is useful in security tests and forensics investigations.
 CeWL is pronounced "cool".

Description: Cisco device scanner
 The main feature that makes cisco-torch different from
 similar tools is the extensive use of forking  to launch
 multiple scanning processes on the background for maximum
 scanning efficiency. Also, it uses several methods of
 application layer fingerprinting simultaneoulsy, if needed.
 We wanted something fast to discover remote Cisco hosts
 running Telnet, SSH, Web, NTP, TFTP and SNMP services and
 launch dicitionary attacks against the services discovered,
 including SNMP community attack (you would like the
 community.txt list :-) and TFTP servers (configuration
 file name bruteforcing with following config leeching). The
 tool can also get device configurationfiles automatically
 if SNMP RW community is found.

Description: swap endianness of a cram filesystem (cramfs)
 cramfs is a highly compressed and size optimized Linux filesystem which is
 mainly used for embedded applications. The problem with cramfs is that it
 is endianness sensitive, meaning you can't mount a cramfs for a big endian
 target on a little endian machine and vice versa. This is often especially
 a problem in the development phase.
 .
 cramfsswap solves that problem by allowing you to swap to endianness of a
 cramfs filesystem.

 .
 The Cython language is very close to the Python language, but Cython
 additionally supports calling C functions and declaring C types on variables
 and class attributes. This allows the compiler to generate very efficient C
 code from Cython code.
 .
 This makes Cython the ideal language for wrapping external C libraries, and
 for fast C modules that speed up the execution of Python code.

Description: simple interprocess messaging system (system message bus)
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus
 decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be
 low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using
 XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but
 it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.
 .
 It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java.
 .
 This package provides a fully-functional D-Bus system bus with activation
 support, used for communication between system services, and depends on
 most of the other components of the reference implementation of D-Bus.
 .
 To provide a complete D-Bus session bus, install one of the packages
 that implement the dbus-session-bus virtual package, such as
 dbus-user-session. The recommended implementation is indicated by
 the default-dbus-session-bus virtual package.

Description: simple interprocess messaging system (systemd --user integration)
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 On systemd systems, this package opts in to the session model in which
 a user's session starts the first time they log in, and does not end
 until all their login sessions have ended. This model merges all
 parallel non-graphical login sessions (text mode, ssh, cron, etc.), and up
 to one graphical session, into a single "user-session" or "super-session"
 within which all background D-Bus services are shared.
 .
 Multiple graphical sessions per user are not currently supported in this
 mode; as a result, it is particularly suitable for gdm, which responds to
 requests to open a parallel graphical session by switching to the existing
 graphical session and unlocking it.
 .
 To retain dbus' traditional session semantics, in which login sessions
 are artificially isolated from each other, remove this package and install
 dbus-x11 instead.
 .

Description: enhanced version of dd for forensics and security
 dcfldd was initially developed at Department of Defense Computer Forensics
 Lab (DCFL). This tool is based on the dd program with the following additional
 features:
 .
  - Hashing on-the-fly: dcfldd can hash the input data as it is being
    transferred, helping to ensure data integrity.
  - Status output: dcfldd can update the user of its progress in terms of the
    amount of data transferred and how much longer operation will take.
  - Flexible disk wipes: dcfldd can be used to wipe disks quickly and with a
    known pattern if desired.
  - Image/wipe verify: dcfldd can verify that a target drive is a bit-for-bit
    match of the specified input file or pattern.
  - Multiple outputs: dcfldd can output to multiple files or disks at the same
    time.
  - Split output: dcfldd can split output to multiple files with more
    configurability than the split command.
  - Piped output and logs: dcfldd can send all its log data and output to
    commands as well as files natively.
  - When dd uses a default block size (bs, ibs, obs) of 512 bytes, dcfldd uses
    32768 bytes (32 KiB) which is HUGELY more efficient.
  - The following options are present in dcfldd but not in dd: ALGORITHMlog:,
    errlog, hash, hashconv, hashformat, hashlog, hashlog:, hashwindow, limit,
    of:, pattern, sizeprobe, split, splitformat, statusinterval, textpattern,
    totalhashformat, verifylog, verifylog:, vf.

Description: data recovery and protection tool
 When your disk has crashed and you try to copy it over to another one,
 standard Unix tools like cp, cat, and dd will abort on every I/O error,
 dd_rescue does not.
 It optimizes copying by using large blocks as long as no errors occur
 and falls back to smaller blocks. It supports reverse direction copying
 (to approach a bad spot from the top), sparse copying, preallocating
 space, splice zerocopy, and bypassing the kernel pagecache with O_DIRECT.
 dd_rescue provides safe deletion of data by overwriting files (or better
 partitions/disks) multiple times with fast random numbers.
 With the ddr_hash plugin, it supports calculating a hash value (such as
 a sha256sum) or an HMAC during copying.

Description: DHCP exhaustion script using scapy network library
 DHCPig initiates an advanced DHCP exhaustion attack. It will consume all IPs
 on the LAN, stop new users from obtaining IPs, release any IPs in use, then
 for good measure send gratuitous ARP and knock all windows hosts offline.
 .
 It is based on the scapy library and requests admin privileges to execute.
 It has been tested on multiple Linux distributions and multiple DHCP servers
 (ISC, Windows 2k3/2k8,..).

Description: File comparison utilities
 The diffutils package provides the diff, diff3, sdiff, and cmp programs.
 .
 `diff' shows differences between two files, or each corresponding file
 in two directories.  `cmp' shows the offsets and line numbers where
 two files differ.  `cmp' can also show all the characters that
 differ between the two files, side by side.  `diff3' shows differences
 among three files.  `sdiff' merges two files interactively.
 .
 The set of differences produced by `diff' can be used to distribute
 updates to text files (such as program source code) to other people.
 This method is especially useful when the differences are small compared
 to the complete files.  Given `diff' output, the `patch' program can
 update, or "patch", a copy of the file.

Description: URL bruteforcing tool
 DIRB is a Web Content Scanner. It looks for existing (and/or hidden) Web
 Objects. It basically works by launching a dictionary based attack against
 a web server and analyzing the responses.
 .
 DIRB comes with a set of preconfigured attack wordlists for easy usage but
 you can use your custom wordlists. Also DIRB sometimes can be used as a
 classic CGI scanner, but remember that it is a content scanner not a
 vulnerability scanner.
 .
 DIRB's main purpose is to help in professional web application auditing.
 Specially in security related testing. It covers some holes not covered by
 classic web vulnerability scanners. DIRB looks for specific web objects that
 other generic CGI scanners can't look for. It doesn't search vulnerabilities
 nor does it look for web contents that can be vulnerable.

Description: Web server directory brute-forcer
 DirBuster is a multi threaded java application designed to
 brute force directories and files names on web/application
 servers. Often is the case now of what looks like a web
 server in a state of default installation is actually not,
 and has pages and applications hidden within. DirBuster
 attempts to find these.
 .
 However tools of this nature are often as only good as the
 directory and file list they come with. A different
 approach was taken to generating this. The list was
 generated from scratch, by crawling the Internet and
 collecting the directory and files that are actually used
 by developers! DirBuster comes a total of 9 different
 lists, this makes DirBuster extremely effective at finding
 those hidden files and directories. And if that was not
 enough DirBuster also has the option to perform a pure
 brute force, which leaves the hidden directories and files
 nowhere to hide.

Description: tool to enumerate domain DNS information
 Dnsenum is a multithreaded perl script to enumerate DNS information of a
 domain and to discover non-contiguous ip blocks. The main purpose of Dnsenum
 is to gather as much information as possible about a domain. The program
 currently performs the following operations:
 .
   1) Get the host's addresses (A record).
   2) Get the namservers (threaded).
   3) Get the MX record (threaded).
   4) Perform axfr queries on nameservers and get BIND versions(threaded).
   5) Get extra names and subdomains via google scraping (google query =
      "allinurl: -www site:domain").
   6) Brute force subdomains from file, can also perform recursion on subdomain
      that have NS records (all threaded).
   7) Calculate C class domain network ranges and perform whois queries on them
      (threaded).
   8) Perform reverse lookups on netranges (C class or/and whois netranges)
      (threaded).
   9) Write to domain_ips.txt file ip-blocks.
 .
 This program is useful for pentesters, ethical hackers and forensics experts.
 It also can be used for security tests.

Maintainer: Debian Security Tools <team+pkg-security@tracker.debian.org>
Architecture: amd64
Version: 0.36-1
Depends: libc6 (>= 2.7)
Description: DNS domain name brute forcing tool
 dnsmap scans a domain for common subdomains using a built-in or an external
 wordlist (if specified using -w option). The internal wordlist has around 1000
 words in English and Spanish as ns1, firewall servicios and smtp. So will be
 possible search for smtp.example.com inside example.com automatically. Results
 can be saved in CSV and human-readable format for further processing. dnsmap
 does NOT require root privileges to be run, and should NOT be run with such
 privileges for security reasons.
 .
 dnsmap was originally released back in 2006 and was inspired by the fictional
 story "The Thief No One Saw" by Paul Craig, which can be found in the book
 "Stealing the Network - How to 0wn the Box".
 .
 dnsmap is mainly meant to be used by pentesters during the information
 gathering/enumeration phase of infrastructure security assessments. During the
 enumeration stage, the security consultant would typically discover the target
 company's IP netblocks, domain names, phone numbers, etc.
 .
 Subdomain brute-forcing is another technique that should be used in the
 enumeration stage, as it's especially useful when other domain enumeration
 techniques such as zone transfers don't work (I rarely see zone transfers being
 publicly allowed these days by the way).
 .
 Fun things that can happen:
 .
   1) Finding interesting remote access servers
      (e.g.: https:://extranet.example.com).
   2) Finding badly configured and/or unpatched servers
      (e.g.: test.example.com).
   3) Finding new domain names which will allow you to map
      non-obvious/hard-to-find netblocks of your target organization
      (registry lookups - aka whois is your friend).
   4) Sometimes you find that some bruteforced subdomains resolve to internal IP
      addresses (RFC 1918). This is great as sometimes they are real up-to-date
      "A" records which means that it is possible to enumerate internal servers
      of a target organization from the Internet by only using standard DNS
      resolving (as opposed to zone transfers for instance).
   5) Discover embedded devices configured using Dynamic DNS services
      (e.g.: IP Cameras). This method is an alternative to finding devices via
      Google hacking techniques.
 .
 This package provides two possible commands: dnsmap and dnsmap-bulk.
 .
 This program is useful for pentesters, ethical hackers and forensics experts.
 It also can be used for security tests.

Description: standard XML documentation system for software and systems
 DocBook is an XML document type definition (DTD).  That is, it
 contains the "DocBook" document structure.  This is used by authors
 or editors writing documents in the DocBook XML format.  DocBook was
 designed for books, articles, or reference documentation about
 technical matters or software.  It has emerged as an open, standard
 DTD in the software industry, and is the documentation system of
 choice for many free software projects.
 .
 This package contains the XML DTD for DocBook, which describes the
 formal structure for documents following this format.  If you wish to
 author DocBook documents using SGML rather than XML, use the
 'docbook' package.  You will need other packages in order to edit
 (psgml), validate (opensp, libxml2-utils) or format (docbook-xsl,
 docbook-dsssl) DocBook documents.
 .
 This package ships with the latest DocBook 4.5 XML DTD, as well as a
 selected set of legacy DTDs for use with older documents, including
 4.0, 4.1.2, 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4.

Description: convert text file line endings between CRLF and LF
 This package contains utilities dos2unix, unix2dos, mac2unix,
 unix2mac to convert the line endings of text files between UNIX (LF),
 DOS (CRLF) and Mac (CR) formats.
 .
 Text files under Windows and DOS typically have two ASCII characters
 at the end of each line: CR (carriage return) followed by LF (line
 feed). Older Macs used just CR, while UNIX uses just LF. While most
 modern editors can read all these formats, there may still be a need
 to convert files between them.
 .
 This is the classic utility developed in 1989.

Description: Collaboration tools for penetration testing
 Dradis is a tool to help in the process of penetration testing. Penetration
 testing is about information:
 .
  1. Information discovery
  2. Exploit useful information
  3. Report the findings
 .
 But penetration testing is also about sharing the information you and your
 teammates gather. Not sharing the information available in an effective way
 will result in exploitation oportunities lost and the overlapping of efforts.

Description: Tool for extracting and cracking EAP-MD5
 EAP-MD5 is a legacy authentication mechanism that does not provide sufficient
 protection for user authentication credentials.  Users who authenticate using
 EAP-MD5 subject themselves to an offline dictionary attack vulnerability.
 .
 This tool reads from a live network interface in monitor-mode, or from a
 stored libpcap capture file, and extracts the portions of the EAP-MD5
 authentication exchange.  Once the challenge and response portions have been
 collected from this exchange, eapmd5pass will mount an offline dictionary
 attack against the user's password.

 eSpeak produces good quality English speech. It uses a different synthesis
 method from other open source text to speech (TTS) engines, and sounds quite
 different. It's perhaps not as natural or "smooth", but some find the
 articulation clearer and easier to listen to for long periods.
 .
 It can run as a command line program to speak text from a file or from stdin.
 .
   * Includes different Voices, whose characteristics can be altered.
   * Can produce speech output as a WAV file.
   * Can translate text to phoneme codes, so it could be adapted as a front end
     for another speech synthesis engine.
   * Potential for other languages. More than 40 languages are included.
   * Compact size. The program and its data total about 350 kbytes.
   * Written in C++.

Description: configuration for the Exim MTA (v4)
 Exim (v4) is a mail transport agent. exim4-config provides the configuration
 for the exim4 daemon packages. The configuration framework has been split
 off the main package to allow sites to replace the configuration scheme
 with their own without having to change the actual exim4 packages.
 .
 Sites with special configuration needs (having a lot of identically
 configured machines for example) can use this to distribute their own
 custom configuration via the packaging system, using the magic
 available with dpkg's conffile handling, without having to do local
 changes on all of these machines.

 Expect is a tool for automating interactive applications according to a script.
 Following the script, Expect knows what can be expected from a program and what
 the correct response should be. Expect is also useful for testing these same
 applications. And by adding Tk, you can also wrap interactive applications in
 X11 GUIs. An interpreted language provides branching and high-level control
 structures to direct the dialogue. In addition, the user can take control and
 interact directly when desired, afterward returning control to the script.
 .

 fakeroot provides a fake "root environment" by means of LD_PRELOAD and
 SysV IPC (or TCP) trickery. It puts wrappers around getuid(), chown(),

 users can (for instance) populate .deb archives with root-owned files;
 various build tools use fakeroot for this by default.

 This package contains fakeroot command and the daemon that remembers
 fake ownership/permissions of files manipulated by fakeroot
 processes.

Description: Domain DNS scanner
 Fierce is a semi-lightweight scanner that helps locate non-contiguous
 IP space and hostnames against specified domains. It's really meant as
 a pre-cursor to nmap, unicornscan, nessus, nikto, etc, since all of
 those require that you already know what IP space you are looking for.
 This does not perform exploitation and does not scan the whole internet
 indiscriminately. It is meant specifically to locate likely targets both
 inside and outside a corporate network.
 .
 Because it uses DNS primarily you will often find mis-configured networks
 that leak internal address space. That's especially useful in targeted malware.
 Originally written by RSnake along with others at http://ha.ckers.org/.
 This is simply a conversion to Python 3 to simplify and modernize the codebase.

Description: Free Lossless Audio Codec - command line tools
 FLAC stands for Free Lossless Audio Codec. Grossly oversimplified, FLAC is
 similar to MP3, but lossless.  The FLAC project consists of:
 .
  * The stream format
  * libFLAC, which implements a reference encoder, stream decoder, and file
    decoder
  * flac, which is a command-line wrapper around libFLAC to encode and decode
    .flac files
  * Input plugins for various music players (Winamp, XMMS, and more in the
    works)
 .
 This package contains the command-line tools flac (used for encoding and
 decoding FLACs) and metaflac (used for manipulating FLAC metadata.)

Description: fast lexical analyzer generator
 Flex is a tool for generating scanners: programs which recognized lexical
 patterns in text. It reads the given input files for a description of a
 scanner to generate. The description is in the form of pairs of regular
 expressions and C code, called rules. Flex generates as output a C source
 file, lex.yy.c, which defines a routine yylex().  This file is compiled
 and linked with the -lfl library to produce an executable. When the
 executable is run, it analyzes its input for occurrences of the regular
 expressions. Whenever it finds one, it executes the corresponding C code.

Description: generic font configuration library - support binaries
 Fontconfig is a font configuration and customization library, which
 does not depend on the X Window System. It is designed to locate
 fonts within the system and select them according to requirements
 specified by applications.
 .
 Fontconfig is not a rasterization library, nor does it impose a
 particular rasterization library on the application. The X-specific
 library 'Xft' uses fontconfig along with freetype to specify and
 rasterize fonts.
 .
 This package contains a program to maintain the fontconfig cache
 (fc-cache), a sample program to list installed fonts (fc-list), a program
 to test the matching rules (fc-match) and a program to dump the binary
 cache files in string form (fc-cat). It no longer makes fonts managed by defoma
 available to fontconfig applications.

Description: Typeface designed for source code
 No frills. No gimmicks. Hack is hand groomed and optically balanced to be a
 workhorse face for code.
 .
 It has deep roots in the libre, open source typeface community and expands upon
 the contributions of the Bitstream Vera & DejaVu projects. The face has been
 re-designed with a larger glyph set, modifications of the original glyph shapes
 (including distinct point styles and semi-bold punctuation weight in the
 regular set to make analphabetic characters less transparent), and meticulous
 attention to metrics (including numerous spacing adjustments to improve the
 rhythm of the face and the legibility of code at small text sizes). The large
 x-height + wide aperture + low contrast design combined with PostScript
 hinting/hint replacement programs and a TrueType instruction set make it highly
 legible at commonly used source code text sizes with a sweet spot that runs in
 the 8px - 12px range on modern desktop and laptop monitors.
 .
 This package contains the TrueType fonts and the Webfont (WOFF/WOFF2) versions.

Description: GObject introspection bindings for libmalcontent
 malcontent implements support for restricting the type of content accessible
 to non-administrator accounts on a Linux system. Typically, when this is used,
 a non-administrator account will be for a child using the system; and the
 administrator accounts will be for the parents; and the content being filtered
 will be apps which are not suitable for the child to use, due to (for example)
 being too violent.
 .
 This is not a security boundary, and a sufficiently technically advanced user
 may always work around these parental controls. malcontent is not a mandatory
 access control (MAC) system like AppArmor or SELinux. However, its correct use
 by applications should provide enough of an obstacle to prevent users easily or
 accidentally having access to content which they shouldn’t.

Description: Web content engine library for GTK - GObject introspection data
 WebKit is a web content engine, derived from KHTML and KJS from KDE, and
 used primarily in Apple's Safari browser.  It is made to be embedded in
 other applications, such as mail readers, or web browsers.
 .
 It is able to display content such as HTML, SVG, XML, and others. It also
 supports DOM, XMLHttpRequest, XSLT, CSS, JavaScript/ECMAScript and more.
 .
 WebKit2 is an API layer for WebKit designed from the ground up to
 support a split process model, where the web content lives in a
 separate process from the application UI.
 .
 This build comes from the GTK port of WebKit (API version 4.0).
 .
 This package contains introspection data, which can be used by
 packages using the GIRepository format to generate dynamic bindings.

Description: Extensions to extend functionality of GNOME Shell
 The GNOME Shell redefines user interactions with the GNOME desktop. In
 particular, it offers new paradigms for launching applications,
 accessing documents, and organizing open windows in GNOME. Later, it
 will introduce a new applets eco-system and offer new solutions for
 other desktop features, such as notifications and contacts management.
 The GNOME Shell is intended to replace functions handled by the GNOME
 Panel and by the window manager in previous versions of GNOME. The GNOME
 Shell has rich visual effects enabled by new graphical technologies.
 .
 GNOME Shell is extensible using extensions. This package contains
 official GNOME Shell extensions.

Description: Go programming language compiler, linker, compiled stdlib
 The Go programming language is an open source project to make programmers more

 mechanisms make it easy to write programs that get the most out of multicore
 and networked machines, while its novel type system enables flexible and
 modular program construction. Go compiles quickly to machine code yet has the
 convenience of garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection. It's a
 fast, statically typed, compiled language that feels like a dynamically typed,
 interpreted language.

 It includes an advanced key management facility and is compliant
 with the proposed OpenPGP Internet standard as described in RFC4880.
 .
 This package contains /usr/bin/gpg itself, and is useful on its own
 only for public key operations (encryption, signature verification,
 listing OpenPGP certificates, etc).  If you want full capabilities
 (including secret key operations, network access, etc), please
 install the "gnupg" package, which pulls in the full suite of tools.

Description: rich set of graph drawing tools
 Graph drawing addresses the problem of visualizing structural information
 by constructing geometric representations of abstract graphs and networks.
 Automatic generation of graph drawings has important applications in key
 technologies such as database design, software engineering, VLSI and
 network design and visual interfaces in other domains. Situations where
 these tools might be particularly useful include:
 .
   * you would like to restructure a program and first need to understand
     the relationships between its types, procedures, and source files
   * you need to find the bottlenecks in an Internet backbone - not only
     individual links, but their relationships
   * you're debugging a protocol or microarchitecture represented as a
     finite state machine and need to figure out how a certain
     error state arises
   * you would like to browse a database schema, knowledge base, or
     distributed program represented graphically
   * you would like to see an overview of a collection of linked documents
   * you would like to discover patterns and communities of interest in a
     database of telephone calls or e-mail messages
 .
 This package contains the command-line tools.

Description: GNU grep, egrep and fgrep
 'grep' is a utility to search for text in files; it can be used from the
 command line or in scripts.  Even if you don't want to use it, other packages
 on your system probably will.
 .
 The GNU family of grep utilities may be the "fastest grep in the west".
 GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about
 twice as fast as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper
 search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being
 considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to
 look at every character. The result is typically many times faster
 than Unix grep or egrep. (Regular expressions containing backreferencing
 will run more slowly, however.)

Description: GStreamer 1.0 plugin for the PipeWire multimedia server
 PipeWire is a server and user space API to deal with multimedia
 pipelines. This includes:
 .
  - Making available sources of video (such as from a capture devices or
    application provided streams) and multiplexing this with clients.
  - Accessing sources of video for consumption.
  - Generating graphs for audio and video processing.
 .
 This package contains a plugin to make devices managed by the PipeWire
 server available as GStreamer sources and sinks.

Description: GStreamer plugins from the "bad" set
 GStreamer is a streaming media framework, based on graphs of filters
 which operate on media data.  Applications using this library can do
 anything from real-time sound processing to playing videos, and just
 about anything else media-related.  Its plugin-based architecture means
 that new data types or processing capabilities can be added simply by
 installing new plug-ins.
 .
 GStreamer Bad Plug-ins is a set of plug-ins that aren't up to par compared
 to the rest. They might be close to being good quality, but they're missing
 something - be it a good code review, some documentation, a set of tests, a
 real live maintainer, or some actual wide use.

Description: GStreamer plugins from the "ugly" set
 GStreamer is a streaming media framework, based on graphs of filters
 which operate on media data.  Applications using this library can do
 anything from real-time sound processing to playing videos, and just
 about anything else media-related.  Its plugin-based architecture means
 that new data types or processing capabilities can be added simply by
 installing new plug-ins.
 .
 This package contains plugins from the "ugly" set, a set of
 good-quality plug-ins that might pose distribution problems.

Description: icon theme caching utility
 gtk-update-icon-cache creates mmap()able cache files for icon themes.
 .
 GTK can use the cache files created by gtk-update-icon-cache to avoid a lot
 of system call and disk seek overhead when the application starts. Since the
 format of the cache files allows them to be mmap()ed shared between multiple
 applications, the overall memory consumption is reduced as well.

Description: VoIP flooder tool
 A UDP Inter-Asterisk_eXchange (i.e. IAX) packet was captured
 from an IAX channel between two Asterisk IP PBX's. The
 content of that packet is the source of the payload for the
 attack embodied by this tool. While the IAX protocol header
 might not match the Asterisk PBX you'll attack with this
 tool, it may require more processing on the part of the PBX
 than a simple udpflood without any payload that even
 resembles an IAX payload.

Description: User space provider drivers for libibverbs
 libibverbs is a library that allows userspace processes to use RDMA
 "verbs" as described in the InfiniBand Architecture Specification and
 the RDMA Protocol Verbs Specification.  iWARP ethernet NICs support
 RDMA over hardware-offloaded TCP/IP, while InfiniBand is a
 high-throughput, low-latency networking technology.  InfiniBand host
 channel adapters (HCAs) and iWARP NICs commonly support direct
 hardware access from userspace (kernel bypass), and libibverbs
 supports this when available.
 .
 An RDMA driver consists of a kernel portion and a user space portion.
 This package contains the user space verbs drivers:

Description: configure network interfaces for parallel routing (bonding)
 This is a tool to attach and detach slave network interfaces to a bonding
 device. A bonding device will act like a normal Ethernet network device to
 the kernel, but will send out the packets via the slave devices using a simple
 round-robin scheduler. This allows for simple load-balancing, identical to
 "channel bonding" or "trunking" techniques used in switches.
 .
 The kernel must have support for bonding devices for ifenslave to be useful.

 Industrial I/O subsystem is intended to provide support for devices
 that in some sense are analog to digital or digital to analog convertors
 .
 Devices that fall into this category are:
  * ADCs
  * Accelerometers
  * Gyros
  * IMUs
  * Capacitance to Digital Converters (CDCs)
  * Pressure Sensors
  * Color, Light and Proximity Sensors
  * Temperature Sensors
  * Magnetometers
  * DACs
  * DDS (Direct Digital Synthesis)
  * PLLs (Phase Locked Loops)
  * Variable/Programmable Gain Amplifiers (VGA, PGA)
 .
 Many ultrabooks ship with some of these devices. iio-sensor-proxy is
 intended to serve as a proxy, providing access to these devices through
 a D-Bus interface

Description: discover and fingerprint IKE hosts (IPsec VPN Servers)
 ike-scan discovers IKE hosts and can also fingerprint them using the
 retransmission backoff pattern.
 .
 ike-scan does two things:
 .
 a) Discovery: Determine which hosts are running IKE.
    This is done by displaying those hosts which respond to the IKE requests
    sent by ike-scan.
 .
 b) Fingerprinting: Determine which IKE implementation the hosts are using.
    This is done by recording the times of the IKE response packets from the
    target hosts and comparing the observed retransmission backoff pattern
    against known patterns.
 .
    The retransmission backoff fingerprinting concept is discussed in more
    detail in the UDP backoff fingerprinting paper which should be included
    in the ike-scan kit as udp-backoff-fingerprinting-paper.txt.

Description: Input method configuration framework
 im-config package provides the framework to configure and to switch
 the input method. This input method is the essential mechanism for
 Japanese, Chinese and Korean (CJK) languages to enter their non-ASCII
 native characters.
 .
 Many modern input methods such as IBus support not only one of these CJK
 languages but support almost all languages simultaneously by
 dynamically switching keyboard modes with GUI helper program.
 .
 By installing this package, the most desirable input method and its
 backend conversion engine are automatically configured with both the X
 Window System Input Method (XIM), GTK input method module, Qt input
 method module, and clutter input method module.
 .
 You can further customize your input method with 'im-config' command.

Description: helper tools for all init systems
 This package contains helper tools that are necessary for switching between
 the various init systems that Debian contains (e. g. sysvinit or
 systemd). An example is deb-systemd-helper, a script that enables systemd unit
 files without depending on a running systemd.
 .
 It also includes the "service", "invoke-rc.d", and "update-rc.d" scripts which
 provide an abstraction for enabling, disabling, starting, and stopping
 services for all supported Debian init systems as specified by the policy.
 .
 While this package is maintained by pkg-systemd-maintainers, it is NOT
 specific to systemd at all. Maintainers of other init systems are welcome to
 include their helpers in this package.

Description: Intercept Java applications locally
 Normally, without access to the original source code,
 testing the security of a Java client is unpredictable at
 best and unrealistic at worst. With access the original
 source, you can run a simple Java program and attach a
 debugger to it remotely, stepping through code and changing
 variables where needed. Doing the same with an applet is a
 little bit more difficult.
 JavaSnoop attempts to solve this problem by allowing you
 attach to an existing process (like a debugger) and
 instantly begin tampering with method calls, run custom
 code, or just watch what's happening on the system.

 Dylan, and then later adopted as the preferred MRO (Method Resolution Order)
 for the new-style classes in Python 2.3. Most recently it has been adopted as
 the 'canonical' MRO for Perl 6 classes, and the default MRO for Parrot

 Note that only the LCSidx function is optimized in XS at the moment, which
 means only compact_diff will get significantly faster for large data sets,
 while diff and sdiff will run in identical speed as Algorithm::Diff.

Description: Library to access AppStream services
 AppStream is a metadata specification which permits software components to
 provide information about themselves to automated systems and end-users
 before the software is actually installed.
 This permits informative displays of new applications to users in software
 centers, as well as allowing a system to make decisions on which new software
 a user might want to install (e.g. missing firmware or media handlers).
 .
 This package contains a GObject-based library to access AppStream
 services, like the software component metadata pool.
 It also contains functions for reading, writing and transforming AppStream
 metadata.

Description: Multi-format archive and compression library (shared library)
 The libarchive library provides a flexible interface for reading and writing
 archives in various formats such as tar and cpio. libarchive also supports
 reading and writing archives compressed using various compression filters such
 as gzip and bzip2. The library is inherently stream-oriented; readers serially
 iterate through the archive, writers serially add things to the archive.
 .
 Archive formats supported are:
 .
    * tar (read and write, including GNU extensions)
    * pax (read and write, including GNU and star extensions)
    * cpio (read and write, including odc and newc variants)
    * iso9660 (read and write, including Joliet and Rockridge extensions, with

      empty file)
    * raw (read only)
    * xar (read only)
    * rar (read only, with some limitations)
    * 7zip (read and write, with some limitations)
 .
 Filters supported are:
 .
    * gzip (read and write, uses zlib)
    * bzip2 (read and write, uses bzlib)
    * compress (read and write, uses an internal implementation)

Description: memory-hard hashing function - runtime library
 Argon2 is a password-hashing function that can be used to hash passwords
 for credential storage, key derivation, or other applications.
 .
 There are two main versions of Argon2: Argon2i and Argon2d.
 Argon2i is the safest against side-channel attacks, while Argon2d provides
 the highest resistance against GPU cracking attacks.
 .
 Argon2i and Argon2d are parametrized by:
  * A time cost, which defines the amount of computation realized and
    therefore the execution time, given in number of iterations
  * A memory cost, which defines the memory usage, given in kibibytes
  * A parallelism degree, which defines the number of parallel threads
 .
 This package includes the dynamic library against which programs are linked.

Description: Fortran77 subroutines to solve large scale eigenvalue problems
 ARPACK software is capable of solving large scale symmetric,
 nonsymmetric, and generalized eigenproblems from significant
 application areas. The software is designed to compute a few (k)
 eigenvalues with user specified features such as those of largest
 real part or largest magnitude. Storage requirements are on the order
 of n*k locations. No auxiliary storage is required. A set of Schur
 basis vectors for the desired k-dimensional eigen-space is computed
 which is numerically orthogonal to working precision. Numerically
 accurate eigenvectors are available on request.
 .
 Important Features:
 .
  * Reverse Communication Interface.
  * Single and Double Precision Real Arithmetic Versions for Symmetric,
    Non-symmetric,
  * Standard or Generalized Problems.
  * Single and Double Precision Complex Arithmetic Versions for Standard or
    Generalized Problems.
  * Routines for Banded Matrices - Standard or Generalized Problems.
  * Routines for The Singular Value Decomposition.
  * Example driver routines that may be used as templates to implement
    numerous Shift-Invert strategies for all problem types, data types and
    precision.

Description: Library for manipulating block devices
 libblockdev is a C library with GObject introspection support that can be used
 for doing low-level operations with block devices like setting up LVM, BTRFS,
 LUKS or MD RAID.
 .
 The library uses plugins (LVM, BTRFS,...) and serves as a thin wrapper around
 its plugins' functionality. All the plugins, however, can be used as
 standalone libraries. One of the core principles of libblockdev is that it is
 stateless from the storage configuration's perspective (e.g. it has no
 information about VGs when creating an LV).

Description: high performance meta-compressor optimized for binary data
 Blosc is a high performance compressor optimized for binary data. It has been
 designed to transmit data to the processor cache faster than the traditional,
 non-compressed, direct memory fetch approach via a memcpy() OS call. Blosc is
 meant not only to reduce the size of large datasets on-disk or in-memory, but
 also to accelerate memory-bound computations.
 .
 It uses the blocking technique to reduce activity on the memory bus as much
 as possible. In short, this technique works by dividing datasets in blocks
 that are small enough to fit in caches of modern processors and perform
 compression / decompression there. It also leverages, if available, SIMD
 instructions (SSE2) and multi-threading capabilities of CPUs, in order to
 accelerate the compression / decompression process to a maximum.

 Regular expressions are a form of pattern-matching that are often

 of which make extensive use of regular expressions. Traditionally C++
 users have been limited to the POSIX C APIs for manipulating regular
 expressions, and while regex does provide these APIs, they do not
 represent the best way to use the library. For example regex can cope
 with wide character strings, or search and replace operations (in a
 manner analogous to either sed or perl), something that traditional C
 libraries can not do.

 The Bauer stereophonic-to-binaural DSP (bs2b) is designed to improve
 headphone listening of stereo audio records.
 .
 Typical stereo recordings are made for listening with speakers.
 What's missing in headphones is the sound going from each channel
 to the opposite ear, arriving a short time later for the extra distance
 traveled, and with a bit of high frequency roll-off for the shadowing
 effect of the head. The time delay to the far ear should also be
 somewhat longer at low frequencies than at high frequencies. bs2b
 implements both of these ideas to transform stereophonic recordings
 for headphone listening.

Description: Perl extension to generate cryptographically-secure random bytes
 Bytes::Random::Secure provides two interfaces for obtaining crypt-quality
 random bytes. The simple interface is built around plain functions. For
 greater control over the Random Number Generator's seeding, there is an
 Object Oriented interface that provides much more flexibility.
 .
 The "functions" interface provides five functions that can be used any time
 you need a string (or MIME Base64 representation, or hex-digits
 representation, or Quoted Printable representation) of a specific number of
 random bytes. There are equivalent methods available via the OO interface.
 .
 Bytes::Random::Secure can be a drop-in replacement for Bytes::Random, with
 the primary enhancement of using a much higher quality random number
 generator to create the random data. The random_bytes function emulates the
 user interface of Bytes::Random's function by the same name. But with
 Bytes::Random::Secure the random number generator comes from
 Math::Random::ISAAC, and is suitable for cryptographic purposes. The harder
 problem to solve is how to seed the generator. This module uses
 Crypt::Random::Seed to generate the initial seeds for Math::Random::ISAAC.

Description: Cairo 2D vector graphics library
 Cairo is a multi-platform library providing anti-aliased
 vector-based rendering for multiple target backends. Paths consist
 of line segments and cubic splines and can be rendered at any width
 with various join and cap styles. All colors may be specified with
 optional translucence (opacity/alpha) and combined using the
 extended Porter/Duff compositing algebra as found in the X Render
 Extension.
 .
 Cairo exports a stateful rendering API similar in spirit to the path
 construction, text, and painting operators of PostScript, (with the
 significant addition of translucence in the imaging model). When
 complete, the API is intended to support the complete imaging model of
 PDF 1.4.

 .
 JPEG-LS (ISO-14495-1/ITU-T.87) is a standard derived from the Hewlett Packard
 LOCO algorithm. JPEG LS has low complexity (meaning fast compression) and high
 compression ratios, similar to JPEG 2000. JPEG-LS is more similar to the old
 Lossless JPEG than to JPEG 2000, but interestingly the two different techniques
 result in vastly different performance characteristics.

 It's often useful to test whether a module can be loaded, instead of throwing
 an error when it's not available. For that, Class::Load provides
 "try_load_class 'Class::Name'".
 .
 Finally, sometimes it is important to know whether a particular class has
 been loaded. Asking %INC is an option, but that will miss inner packages and
 any class for which the filename does not correspond to the package name. For
 that, this module provides "is_class_loaded 'Class::Name'".

Description: Perl module providing method modifiers
 Class::Method::Modifiers provides three modifiers: before, around, and after.
 The before and after modifiers are run just before and after the method they
 modify, but cannot really affect that original method. The remaining modifier,
 around, is run in place of the original method, with a hook to easily call the
 original method.

Description: Perl module providing fast XS accessors
 Class::XSAccessor implements fast XS accessors both for getting at and setting
 an object attribute. Additionally, the module supports mutators and simple
 predicates like those for testing the truth value of a variable. It works only
 with objects that are implemented as ordinary hashes.
 .
 The XS accessor methods were between 1.6 and 2.5 times faster than typical
 pure-perl accessors in some simple benchmarking. If you usually write clear
 code, a factor of two speed-up is a good estimate.
 .
 Refer to Class::XSAccessor::Array (also included in libclass-xsaccessor-perl)
 for an implementation that works with array-based objects.

 It is faster (although less flexible) than Storable's dclone. Its
 functionality is _not_ serializing in-memory objects (i.e. as
 Data::Dumper or YAML::Dump do), but deep-copying them over to new
 in-memory structures.

 loaded by LWP::Protocol::https on HTTPS requests, and provides the
 necessary SSL glue for that module to work via these deprecated modules:
 Crypt::SSLeay::CTX, Crypt::SSLeay::Conn and Crypt::SSLeay::X509.
 .
 Work on Crypt::SSLeay has been continued only to provide HTTPS support
 for the LWP - libwww perl libraries. If you want access to the OpenSSL
 API via perl, check out Sampo's Net::SSLeay (available in Debian as

 libdaemon is a lightweight C library which eases the writing of UNIX daemons.
 It consists of the following parts:
 .
  * Wrapper around fork() for correct daemonization of a process
  * Wrapper around syslog() for simple log output to syslog or STDERR
  * An API for writing PID files
  * An API for serializing signals into a pipe for use with select() or poll()
  * An API for running subprocesses with STDOUT and STDERR redirected to syslog
 .
 Routines like these are included in most of the daemon software available. It
 is not simple to get these done right and code duplication is not acceptable.
 .
 This package includes the libdaemon run time shared library.

Description: Perl DBI driver with a self-contained RDBMS
 DBD::SQLite is a Perl DBI driver with a self-contained relational database
 management system. It embeds a small and fast embedded SQL database engine
 called SQLite (see sqlite3) into a DBI driver. It is useful if you want a
 relational database for your project, but don't want to install a large
 RDBMS system like MySQL or PostgreSQL.
 .
 SQLite supports the following features:
 .
  * Implements a large subset of SQL92 (<URL:http://www.sqlite.org/lang.html>)
  * A complete DB in a single disk file
    Everything for your database is stored in a single disk file, making it
    easier to move things around than with DBD::CSV.
  * Atomic commit and rollback
 .
 The engine is very fast, but for updates/inserts/dml it does perform a global
 lock on the entire database. This, obviously, might not be good for multiple
 user systems. The database also appears to be significantly faster if your
 transactions are coarse.

Description: custom op checking attached to subroutines
 Devel::CallChecker makes some new features of the Perl 5.14.0 C API
 available to XS modules running on older versions of Perl.
 The features are centred around the function cv_set_call_checker,
 which allows XS code to attach a magical annotation
 to a Perl subroutine,
 resulting in resolvable calls to that subroutine
 being mutated at compile time by arbitrary C code.
 This module makes cv_set_call_checker
 and several supporting functions available.
 (It is possible to achieve the effect of cv_set_call_checker
 from XS code on much earlier Perl versions,
 but it is painful to achieve without the centralised facility.)

Description: perl module to create bubble-babble fingerprints
 Digest::BubbleBabble takes a message digest (generated by
 either of the MD5 or SHA-1 message digest algorithms) and creates
 a fingerprint of that digest in "bubble babble" format.
 Bubble babble is a method of representing a message digest
 as a string of "real" words, to make the fingerprint easier
 to remember. The "words" are not necessarily real words, but
 they look more like words than a string of hex characters.
 .
 Bubble babble fingerprinting is used by the SSH2 suite
 (and, consequently, by Net::SSH::Perl, the Perl SSH
 implementation) to display easy-to-remember key fingerprints.
 The key (a DSA or RSA key) is converted into a textual form,
 digested using Digest::SHA, and run through bubblebabble
 to create the key fingerprint.

Depends: perl:any, libmodule-runtime-perl (>= 0.009)
Description: module for declaring version conflicts for a distribution
 One shortcoming of the CPAN clients that currently exist is that they have no
 way of specifying conflicting downstream dependencies of modules.
 Dist::CheckConflicts attempts to work around this issue by allowing you to
 specify conflicting versions of modules separately, and deal with them after
 the module is done installing.
 .
 For instance, say you have a module Foo, and some other module Bar uses Foo.
 If Foo were to change its API in a non-backwards-compatible way, this would
 cause Bar to break until it is updated to use the new API. Foo can't just
 depend on the fixed version of Bar, because this will cause a circular
 dependency (because Bar is already depending on Foo), and this doesn't
 express intent properly anyway - Foo doesn't use Bar at all. The ideal
 solution would be for there to be a way to specify conflicting versions of
 modules in a way that would let CPAN clients update conflicting modules
 automatically after an existing module is upgraded, but until that happens,
 this module will allow users to do this manually.

Depends: perl:any
Description: utility to determine the locale encoding
 In many applications it's wise to let Perl use Unicode for the strings it
 processes. Most of the interfaces Perl has to the outside world are still byte
 based. Programs therefore need to decode byte strings that enter the program
 from the outside and encode them again on the way out.
 .
 The POSIX locale system is used to specify both the language conventions
 requested by the user and the preferred character set to consume and output.
 The Encode::Locale module looks up the charset and encoding (called a CODESET
 in the locale jargon) and arranges for the Encode module to know this encoding
 under the name "locale". It means bytes obtained from the environment can be
 converted to Unicode strings by calling Encode::encode(locale => $bytes) and
 converted back again with Encode::decode(locale => $string).

Description: Perl module for error/exception handling in an OO-ish way
 The Error module provides two interfaces.  Firstly "Error" provides a
 procedural interface to exception handling. Secondly "Error" is a base class
 for errors/exceptions that can either be thrown, for subsequent catch, or can
 simply be recorded.
 .
 Errors in the class "Error" should not be thrown directly, but the user
 should throw errors from a sub-class of "Error".
 .
 Warning: Using the "Error" module is no longer recommended due to the
 black-magical nature of its syntactic sugar, which often tends to break. Its
 maintainers have stopped actively writing code that uses it, and discourage
 people from doing so.
 .
 Recommended alternatives are Exception::Class (libexception-class-perl),
 Error::Exception (not packaged), TryCatch (libtrycatch-perl), and Try::Tiny
 (libtry-tiny-perl).

Description: Perl module to safely and cleanly create closures via string eval
 String eval is often used for dynamic code generation. For instance, Moose
 uses it heavily, to generate inlined versions of accessors and constructors,
 which speeds code up at runtime by a significant amount. String eval is not
 without its issues however - it's difficult to control the scope it's used in
 (which determines which variables are in scope inside the eval), and it can
 be quite slow, especially if doing a large number of evals.
 .
 Eval::Closure attempts to solve both of those problems. It provides an
 eval_closure function, which evals a string in a clean environment, other
 than a fixed list of specified variables. It also caches the result of the
 eval, so that doing repeated evals of the same source, even with a different
 environment, will be much faster (but note that the description is part of
 the string to be evaled, so it must also be the same (or non-existent) if
 caching is to work properly).

Description: Asynchronous event notification library
 Libevent is an asynchronous event notification library that provides a
 mechanism to execute a callback function when a specific event occurs
 on a file descriptor or after a timeout has been reached.
 .
 It is meant to replace the asynchronous event loop found in
 event driven network servers. Currently, libevent supports /dev/poll,
 kqueue(2), event ports, select(2), poll(2) and epoll(4).
 .
 For backward compatibility and to transition to "libevent_core only"
 or "libevent_core + libevent_extra", the libevent source package builds
 the libevent library that includes everything in libevent_core and
 libevent_extra.

    Photoshop store in the same image segment
  * Exif Makernote support:
    - Makernote tags can be read and written just like any other metadata
    - a sophisticated write algorithm avoids corrupting the Makernote
  * a simple interface to extract previews embedded in RAW images and Exif
    thumbnails

Description: Perl module for file locking with fcntl(2)
 File::FcntlLock is a Perl module to do file locking in an object oriented
 fashion using the fcntl(2) system call. This allows locks on parts of a file
 as well as on the whole file and overcomes some known problems with flock(2),
 on which Perl's flock() function is based.

 The first parameter to parse_dir() is the directory listing to parse. It can
 be a scalar, a reference to an array of directory lines or a glob
 representing a filehandle to read the directory listing from.
 .
 The second parameter is the time zone to use when parsing time stamps in the
 listing. If this value is undefined, then the local time zone is assumed.
 .
 The third parameter is the type of listing to assume. Currently supported
 formats are 'unix', 'apache' and 'dosftp'. The default value 'unix'.

Description: Frame Streams (fstrm) library
 Frame Streams is a light weight, binary clean protocol that allows for the
 transport of arbitrarily encoded data payload sequences with minimal framing
 overhead -- just four bytes per data frame. Frame Streams does not specify an
 encoding format for data frames and can be used with any data serialization
 format that produces byte sequences, such as Protocol Buffers, XML, JSON,
 MessagePack, YAML, etc. Frame Streams can be used as both a streaming
 transport over a reliable byte stream socket (TCP sockets, TLS connections,
 AF_UNIX sockets, etc.) for data in motion as well as a file format for data
 at rest. A "Content Type" header identifies the type of payload being carried
 over an individual Frame Stream and allows cooperating programs to determine
 how to interpret a given sequence of data payloads.
 .
 This is the "fstrm" implementation of Frame Streams in C.

Description: conservative garbage collector for C and C++
 Boehm-Demers-Weiser's GC is a garbage collecting storage allocator that is
 intended to be used as a plug-in replacement for C's malloc or C++'s new().
 .
 It allows you to allocate memory basically as you normally would without
 explicitly deallocating memory that is no longer useful. The collector
 automatically recycles memory when it determines that it can no longer be
 used.
 .
 This version of the collector is thread safe, has C++ support and uses the
 defaults for everything else. However, it does not work as a drop-in malloc(3)
 replacement.

 HashMap, HashMultiSet, HashMultiMap, LinkedList, PriorityQueue, Promise,
 TreeSet, TreeMap, TreeMultiSet, and TreeMultiMap classes provide a
 reasonable sample implementation of those interfaces. In addition, a set of
 abstract classes are provided to ease the implementation of new collections.
 .
 Around that, the API provides means to retrieve read-only views, efficient
 sort algorithms, simple, bi-directional or index-based mutable iterators
 depending on the collection type.
 .
 libgee is written in Vala and can be used like any GObject-based C library.
 It's planned to provide bindings for further languages.

Description: GStreamer editing services (shared library)
 The GStreamer multimedia framework and the accompanying NLE set of
 plugins for non-linear editing offer all the building blocks for:
 * Decoding and encoding to a wide variety of formats, through all the
   available GStreamer plugins.
 * Easily choosing segments of streams and arranging them through time
   through the NLE set of plugins.
 But all those building blocks only offer stream-level access, which
 results in developers who want to write non-linear editors to write a
 consequent amount of code to get to the level of non-linear editing
 notions which are closer and more meaningful for the end-user
 (and therefore the application).
 .
 The GStreamer Editing Services (GES) aims to fill the gap between
 GStreamer/NLE and the application developer by offering a series
 of classes to simplify the creation of many kind of editing-related
 applications.
 .
 This package contains the shared library for the GStreamer editing
 services.

Description: Font rendering engine for Complex Scripts -- library
 Graphite is a system that can be used to create and use "smart fonts" capable
 of displaying writing systems with various complex behaviors, such as:
 contextual shaping, ligatures, reordering, split glyphs, bidirectionality,
 stacking diacritics and complex positioning.
 .
 This library was designed and developed by the NRSI (Non-Roman Script
 Initiative) within SIL International (www.sil.org) to act as a complement to
 other smart font rendering technologies with limited practical local
 extensibility. Its purpose is to help meet the needs of a very large number
 of "minority language" communities for local extensibility of complex script
 behaviors.
 .
 The behavior of the rendering engine for a given writing system is specified
 through extra tables added to a TrueType font.  These tables are generated by
 compiling a GDL (Graphite Description Language) source file into a font using
 grcompiler.
 .
 This package contains the shared library.

Description: Shared libraries for GSM speech compressor
 This package contains runtime shared libraries for libgsm, an
 implementation of the European GSM 06.10 provisional standard for
 full-rate speech transcoding, prI-ETS 300 036, which uses RPE/LTP
 (residual pulse excitation/long term prediction) coding at 13 kbit/s.
 .
 GSM 06.10 compresses frames of 160 13-bit samples (8 kHz sampling
 rate, i.e. a frame rate of 50 Hz) into 260 bits; for compatibility
 with typical UNIX applications, this implementation turns frames of
 160 16-bit linear samples into 33-byte frames (1650 Bytes/s).
 The quality of the algorithm is good enough for reliable speaker
 recognition; even music often survives transcoding in recognizable
 form (given the bandwidth limitations of 8 kHz sampling rate).
 .
 The interfaces offered are a front end modelled after compress(1), and
 a library API.  Compression and decompression run faster than realtime
 on most SPARCstations.  The implementation has been verified against the
 ETSI standard test patterns.

 Nettle is a cryptographic library that is designed to fit easily in more or
 less any context: In crypto toolkits for object-oriented languages (C++,
 Python, Pike, ...), in applications like LSH or GNUPG, or even in kernel
 space.
 .
 It tries to solve a problem of providing a common set of cryptographic
 algorithms for higher-level applications by implementing a
 context-independent set of cryptographic algorithms. In that light, Nettle
 doesn't do any memory allocation or I/O, it simply provides the
 cryptographic algorithms for the application to use in any environment and
 in any way it needs.
 .
 This package contains the asymmetric cryptographic algorithms, which,
 require the GNU multiple precision arithmetic library (libgmp) for
 their large integer computations.

 Cookies are a general mechanism which server side connections can use to both
 store and retrieve information on the client side of the connection. For more
 information about cookies refer to
 <URL:http://curl.haxx.se/rfc/cookie_spec.html> and
 <URL:http://www.cookiecentral.com/>. HTTP::Cookies also implements the new
 style cookies described in RFC 2965. The two variants of cookies are supposed
 to be able to coexist happily.
 .
 Instances of the class HTTP::Cookies are able to store a collection of
 Set-Cookie2: and Set-Cookie: headers and are able to use this information to
 initialize Cookie-headers in HTTP::Request objects. The state of a
 HTTP::Cookies object can be saved in and restored from files.

Description: simple http server class
 Instances of the HTTP::Daemon class are HTTP/1.1 servers that listen on a
 socket for incoming requests. The HTTP::Daemon is a subclass of
 IO::Socket::IP, so you can perform socket operations directly on it too.
 .
 The accept() method will return when a connection from a client is available.
 The returned value will be an HTTP::Daemon::ClientConn object which is
 another IO::Socket::IP subclass. Calling the get_request() method on this
 object will read data from the client and return an HTTP::Request object. The
 ClientConn object also provide methods to send back various responses.
 .
 This HTTP daemon does not fork(2) for you. Your application, i.e. the user of
 the HTTP::Daemon is responsible for forking if that is desirable. Also note
 that the user is responsible for generating responses that conform to the
 HTTP/1.1 protocol.

 .
 The PerlDAV library consists of:
 .
  * HTTP::DAV - an object-oriented Web-DAV client API.
  * dave - the DAV Explorer, an end-user Unix console program for

 The HTTP::Headers class encapsulates HTTP-style message headers. The headers
 consist of attribute-value pairs also called fields, which may be repeated,
 and which are printed in a particular order. The field names are cases
 insensitive.
 .
 Instances of this class are usually created as member variables of the
 HTTP::Request and HTTP::Response classes, internal to the library.

 Implementation of IEC 61883, part 1 (CIP, plug registers, and CMP), part 2
 (DV-SD), part 4 (MPEG2-TS), and part 6 (AMDTP). Outside of IIDC, nearly all
 FireWire multimedia devices use IEC 61883 protocols.
 .
 The libiec61883 library provides a higher level API for streaming DV,
 MPEG-2 and audio over Linux IEEE 1394. This includes both reception and
 transmission. It uses the new "rawiso" API of libraw1394, which
 transparently provides mmap-ed DMA for efficient data transfer. It also
 represents the third generation of I/O technology for Linux 1394 for
 these media types thereby removing the complexities of additional kernel
 modules, /dev nodes, and procfs. It also consolidates features for plug
 control registers and connection management that previously existed in
 experimental form in an unreleased version of libavc1394.

Depends: perl, libmodule-runtime-perl
Description: module for importing packages into other packages
 Import::Into creates a global method import::into which you can call on
 any package to import it into another package. This is useful because
 there are many different ways to write exporters: some use Exporter, some
 use Sub::Exporter, some use Moose::Exporter, some use Exporter::Declare
 and some things are pragmas.
 .
 And if you want to re-export other things, you have to know which is which.
 Exporter subclasses provide export_to_level, but if they overrode their
 import method all bets are off. Sub::Exporter provides an into parameter
 but figuring out something used it isn't trivial. Pragmas need to have
 their import method called directly since they affect the current unit of
 compilation. Import::Into can be used to import packages into other packages
 without having to deal with the specific details of every exporting approach.

 .
 The IO::All object is a proxy for IO::File, IO::Dir, IO::Socket, IO::String,
 Tie::File, File::Spec, File::Path and File::ReadBackwards; as well as all the
 DBM and MLDBM modules. You can use most of the methods found in these classes
 and in IO::Handle (which they inherit from). IO::All adds dozens of other
 helpful idiomatic methods including file stat and manipulation functions.

Description: UglifyJS in library form
 UglifyJS is a JavaScript compressor/minifier written in JavaScript. It
 also contains tools that allow one to automate working with JavaScript
 code:
 .
  * A parser which produces an abstract syntax tree (AST) from
    JavaScript code.
  * A code generator which outputs JavaScript code from an AST, also
    providing the option to get a source map.
  * A compressor (optimizer) - it uses the transformer API to optimize
    an AST into a smaller one.
  * A mangler - reduce names of local variables to (usually)
    single-letters.
  * A scope analyzer, which is a tool that augments the AST with
    information about where variables are defined/referenced etc.
  * A tree walker - a simple API allowing you to do something on every
    node in the AST.
  * A tree transformer - another API intended to transform the tree.
 .
 All the above utilities and APIs are defined in ~6500 lines of code
 (except for the effective generation of the source-map, which is
 handled by the source-map module). Compared to alternatives, UglifyJS
 is pretty small.
 .
 This package provides UglifyJS in library form for use by other Javascript
 packages and web applications.

 Underscore provides 60-odd functions that support both the usual
 functional suspects: map, select, invoke - as well as more specialized
 helpers: function binding, javascript templating, deep equality
 testing, and so on.  It delegates to built-in functions, if present, so
 modern browsers will use the native implementations of forEach, map,
 reduce, filter, every, some and indexOf.

Description: C library for creating and accessing dynamic arrays
 Judy is a C library that implements a dynamic array.  Empty Judy arrays are
 declared with null pointers.  A Judy array consumes memory only when
 populated yet can grow to take advantage of all available memory.  Judy's key
 benefits are:  scalability, performance, memory efficiency, and ease of use.
 Judy arrays are designed to grow without tuning into the peta-element range,
 scaling near O(log-base-256).
 .
 Judy arrays are accessed with insert, retrieve, and delete calls for number
 or string indexes.  Configuration and tuning are not required -- in fact not
 possible.  Judy offers sorting, counting, and neighbor/empty searching.
 Indexes can be sequential, clustered, periodic, or random -- it doesn't
 matter to the algorithm.  Judy arrays can be arranged hierarchically to
 handle any bit patterns -- large indexes, sets of keys, etc.
 .
 Judy is often an improvement over common data structures such as:  arrays,
 sparse arrays, hash tables, B-trees, binary trees, linear lists, skiplists,
 other sort and search algorithms, and counting functions.

Description: converts plain array images into multi-size representation
 The LiquidRescale (lqr) library provides a C/C++ API for performing
 non-uniform resizing of images by the seam-carving technique.
 .
 The library takes images in plain array format as input and converts
 them to a multi-size representation.
 .
 Following is a list of features:
 .
   * Areas in the image can be marked for preservation or discard
   * Once the image has been fully processed, the scaling can be done
     in real-time. In fact, the information can be saved and read out
     later without any further processing
   * The resizing is done with a single function which automatically
     performs all the necessary operations; it can also work in
     successive steps without wasting computational time
   * Possibility to tune the carving operation by letting the seams be
     less connected, or more rigid, or both
   * Can export and import the visibility map (the seams)
   * Other images can be attached and undergo the same carving process
     as the parent image
   * The automatic feature detection algorithm can be tuned by
     selecting among different energy gradient functions
   * Reports progress through a customizable interface
   * A signalling system permits one to cleanly handle errors
 .
 The library implements the algorithm described in the paper "Seam
 Carving for Content-Aware Image Resizing" by Shai Avidan and Ariel
 Shamir, which can be found at
 http://www.faculty.idc.ac.il/arik/imret.pdf

 The LWP::Protocol::https module provides support for using HTTPS schemed URLs

 you don't use it directly. Once the module is installed LWP is able to access
 sites using HTTP over SSL/TLS.
 .
 If hostname verification is requested by LWP::UserAgent's ssl_opts, and
 neither SSL_ca_file nor SSL_ca_path is set, then SSL_ca_file is implied to be
 the one provided by ca-certificates.
 .
 This module used to be bundled with libwww-perl, but it was unbundled in
 v6.02 in order to be able to declare its dependencies properly for the CPAN
 tool-chain. Applications that need HTTPS support can just declare their
 dependency on LWP::Protocol::https and will no longer need to know what
 underlying modules to install.

Description: Perl interface to the ISAAC PRNG Algorithm
 Math::Random::ISAAC implements the ISAAC (Indirection, Shift, Accumulate, Add
 and Count) pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) algorithm described on the
 project page at: <URL:http://burtleburtle.net/bob/rand/isaac.html>
 .
 As with other algorithms like the Mersenne Twister (see Math::Random::MT),
 this algorithm is designed to take some seed information and produce seemingly
 random results as output.
 .
 The results are uniformly distributed, unbiased, and unpredictable unless you
 know the seed. The algorithm was published by Bob Jenkins in the late 1990s
 and despite the best efforts of many security researchers, no feasible attacks
 have been found to date.
 .
 For comparison with other algorithms intended to generate random data, the
 Mersenne Twister has a period of 2^19937-1, the related TT800 has a period
 of 2^800-1 values. ISAAC has a period of 2^8295 values on average.

Description: Perl implementation of the ISAAC PRNG (C/XS Accelerated)
 Math::Random::ISAAC::XS implements the same interface as Math::Random::ISAAC

 the module, based on Bob Jenkins' reference implementation in C as described
 in his paper at: <URL:http://burtleburtle.net/bob/rand/isaac.html>
 .
 If you install this package, then any code that uses Math::Random::ISAAC will
 automagically benefit from this faster implementation. Performance increases
 are somewhere on the order of 400-500%.

Description: minimalistic Netlink communication library
 libmnl is a minimalistic user-space library oriented to Netlink developers.
 There are a lot of common tasks in parsing, validating, constructing of
 both the Netlink header and TLVs that are repetitive and easy to get wrong.
 This library aims to provide simple helpers that allows you to re-use code
 and to avoid re-inventing the wheel.
 .
 The main features of this library are:
 .
 Small: the shared library requires around 30KB for an x86-based computer.
 .
 Simple: this library avoids complexity and elaborated abstractions that
 tend to hide Netlink details.
 .
 Easy to use: the library simplifies the work for Netlink-wise developers.
 It provides functions to make socket handling, message building,
 validating, parsing and sequence tracking, easier.
 .
 Easy to re-use: you can use the library to build your own abstraction
 layer on top of this library.
 .
 Decoupling: the interdependency of the main bricks that compose the
 library is reduced, i.e. the library provides many helpers, but the
 programmer is not forced to use them.
 .
 This package contains the shared libraries needed to run programs that use
 the minimalistic Netlink communication library.

Description: modern Perl object system framework
 Moose is an extension of the Perl 5 object system. The main goal of Moose is to
 make Perl 5 Object Oriented programming easier, more consistent, and less
 tedious. With Moose you can think more about what you want to do and less about
 the mechanics of OOP.
 .
 Additionally, Moose is built on top of Class::MOP, which is a metaclass system
 for Perl 5. This means that Moose not only makes building normal Perl 5 objects
 better, but it provides the power of metaclass programming as well.
 .
 Moose also conveniently manages all attributes (including inherited ones) that
 are defined, but also provides facilities for properly initializing instance
 slots, setting defaults where appropriate and performing any necessary type
 constraint checking or coercion.
 .
 More details about the structure of Moose as well as its features can be found
 in the ever-expanding Moose::Cookbook document.

Description: MPEG1 and MPEG2 video decoder library
 libmpeg2 is a library which can decode MPEG1 and MPEG2 video streams.
 .
 The main features in libmpeg2 are:
 .
  * Conformance - libmpeg2 is able to decode all mpeg streams that conform to
    certain restrictions. For streams that follow these restrictions, libmpeg2
    is probably 100% conformant to the mpeg standards - and there's a pretty
    extensive test suite to check this.
 .
  * Speed - there has been huge efforts there, and libmpeg2 is probably the
    fastest library around for what it does.
 .
  * Portability - most of the code is written in C, and when platform-specific
    optimizations are used, there always is a generic C routine to fall back
    on.  This should be portable to all architectures - at least it is known
    people run this code on x86, ppc, sparc, arm and sh4.
 .
  * Reuseability - libmpeg2 is not intended to include any project-specific
    code, but it should still include enough features to be used by very
    diverse projects.
 .
 This package contains the libmpeg2 shared libraries.

Description: low level cryptographic library (symmetric and one-way cryptos)
 Nettle is a cryptographic library that is designed to fit easily in more or
 less any context: In crypto toolkits for object-oriented languages (C++,
 Python, Pike, ...), in applications like LSH or GNUPG, or even in kernel
 space.
 .
 It tries to solve a problem of providing a common set of cryptographic
 algorithms for higher-level applications by implementing a
 context-independent set of cryptographic algorithms. In that light, Nettle
 doesn't do any memory allocation or I/O, it simply provides the
 cryptographic algorithms for the application to use in any environment and
 in any way it needs.
 .
 This package contains the symmetric and one-way cryptographic
 algorithms. To avoid having this package depend on libgmp, the
 asymmetric cryptos reside in a separate library, libhogweed.

 audio. OpenAL's primary audience are application developers and desktop
 users that rely on portable standards like OpenGL, for games and other

 .
 This library is meant as a compatible update/replacement to the OpenAL Sample
 Implementation (the SI). The SI has been unmaintained for quite a while, and
 would require a lot of work to clean up. This is a fork the old Windows version
 to attempt an accelerated ALSA version of an OpenAL implementation.

 OpenAL Soft supports mono, stereo, 4-channel, 5.1, 6.1, and 7.1 output, as
 opposed to the SI's 4-channel max (though it did have some provisions for 6
 channel, this was not 5.1, and was seemingly a "late" addition). OpenAL Soft
 does not support the Vorbis and MP3 extensions, however those were considered
 deprecated even in the SI. It does, though, support some of the newer
 extensions like AL_EXT_FLOAT32 and AL_EXT_MCFORMATS for multi-channel and
 floating-point formats, as well as ALC_EXT_EFX for environmental audio effects,
 and others.

 very simple programs that operate on arrays of data.  The "language"
 is a generic assembly language that represents many of the features
 available in SIMD architectures, including saturated addition and
 subtraction, and many arithmetic operations.
 .
 This package contains the orc shared libraries.  It is typically
 installed automatically when an application or library requires it.

 libostree is a library for managing bootable, immutable, versioned
 filesystem trees. It is like git in that it checksums individual files
 and has a content-addressed object store; unlike git, it "checks out"
 the files using hardlinks into an immutable directory tree. This
 can be used to provide atomic upgrades with rollback, history and
 parallel-installation, particularly useful on "fixed purpose" systems
 such as embedded devices. It is also used by the Flatpak application
 runtime system.

Description: module to inspect and manipulate lexical variables
 PadWalker is a module that allows you to inspect and even modify lexical
 variables in the current "lexical pad stack." Perl tracks which variables
 are accessible and visible in each lexical scope by keeping a separate
 set of variables for each scope. This module looks for a given variable
 by traversing that stack, which allows it to alter anything in the stack,
 even variables not normally accessible in the current scope.
 .
 In practise, this module is useful for checking anything defined in the full
 stack of subroutines that called your function, making it extremely useful
 for debugging. It is, however, not recommended for use in production code.

Description: OpenPGM shared library
 OpenPGM is an open source implementation of the Pragmatic General Multicast
 (PGM) specification in RFC 3208 available at www.ietf.org. PGM is a reliable
 and scalable multicast protocol that enables receivers to detect loss,
 request retransmission of lost data, or notify an application of
 unrecoverable loss. PGM is a receiver-reliable protocol, which means the
 receiver is responsible for ensuring all data is received, absolving the
 sender of reception responsibility. PGM runs over a best effort datagram
 service, currently OpenPGM uses IP multicast but could be implemented above
 switched fabrics such as InfiniBand.
 .
 This is the runtime package for programs that use the OpenPGM library.

 Allbery, and has been renamed to Pod::Text in the core Perl distribution
 (replacing the previous implementation of Pod::Text). The Pod::PlainText
 module is still provided with Pod::Parser solely for backward
 compatibility.
 .
 "Pod::InputObjects": Some input objects needed by Pod::Parser, and for
 advanced users of Pod::Parser that need more about a command besides its name
 and text.
 .
 "Pod::ParseUtils", a module with several object-oriented helpers for POD
 parsing and processing. Probably the most important is Pod::Hyperlink for
 parsing and expanding POD hyperlinks L<...>.
 .
 This distribution is considered to be legacy - it has been superseded by
 Pod::Simple which brings more robustness, unicode and various other benefits.
 It has been removed from perl core after 5.31.0, and is packaged only for
 backward compatibility.

 This library provides weak aliases for pthread functions not provided

 on pthread stubs to use pthreads optionally, becoming thread-safe when
 linked to libpthread, while avoiding any performance hit when running
 single-threaded. libpthread-stubs supports this behavior even on
 platforms which do not supply all the necessary pthread stubs.

 On platforms which already supply all the necessary pthread stubs, this
 package ships only the pkg-config file pthread-stubs.pc, to allow
 libraries to unconditionally express a dependency on pthread-stubs and
 still obtain correct behavior.

Description: Library for managing RDMA connections
 librdmacm is a library that allows applications to set up reliable
 connected and unreliable datagram transfers when using RDMA adapters.
 It provides a transport-neutral interface in the sense that the same
 code can be used for both InfiniBand and iWARP adapters.  The
 interface is based on sockets, but adapted for queue pair (QP) based
 semantics: communication must use a specific RDMA device, and data
 transfers are message-based.
 .
 librdmacm only provides communication management (connection setup
 and tear-down) and works in conjunction with the verbs interface
 provided by libibverbs, which provides the interface used to actually
 transfer data.
 .
 This package contains the shared library.

Description: efficient, principled regular expression library
 RE2 is a fast, safe, thread-friendly alternative to backtracking regular
 expression engines like those used in PCRE, Perl, and Python. It is a C++
 library.
 .
 RE2 uses automata theory to guarantee that regular expression searches run in
 time linear in the size of the input. RE2 implements memory limits, so that
 searches can be constrained to a fixed amount of memory. RE2 is engineered to
 use a small fixed C++ stack footprint no matter what inputs or regular
 expressions it must process; thus RE2 is useful in multithreaded environments
 where thread stacks cannot grow arbitrarily large.
 .
 On large inputs, RE2 is often much faster than backtracking engines; its use
 of automata theory lets it apply optimizations that the others cannot.

Depends: perl:any, libclass-method-modifiers-perl
Description: Perl module for minimalist role composition
 Role::Tiny is a Perl module to do minimalist role composition. Role composition
 can be thought of as much more clever and meaningful multiple inheritance.
 .
 The basics of this implementation of roles is:
  * If a method is already defined on a class, that method will not be composed
    in from the role.
  * If a method that the role "requires" to be implemented is not implemented,
    role application will fail loudly.
 .
 Unlike Class::C3, where the last class inherited from "wins", role composition
 is the other way around, where first wins. In a more complete system (see
 Moose) roles are checked to see if they clash. The goal of this is to be much
 simpler, hence disallowing composition of multiple roles at once.

 libsamplerate (aka Secret Rabbit Code) is a library for audio rate conversion.
 .
 libsamplerate currently provides three different sample rate conversion
 algorithms; zero order hold, linear interpolation and FIR filter interpolation
 (using filters derived from the mathematical SINC function). The first two
 algorithms (zero order hold and linear) are included for completeness and are
 not recommended for any application where high quality sample rate conversion
 is required. For the FIR/Sinc algorithm, three converters are provided;
 SRC_SINC_FASTEST, SRC_SINC_MEDIUM_QUALITY and SRC_SINC_BEST_QUALITY to allow a
 trade off between conversion speed and conversion quality.
 .
 libsamplerate is capable of downsampling to 1/256 of the original sample rate
 and upsampling to 256 times the original sample rate. It is also capable of
 time varying conversions for vary speed effects and synchronising of two
 unlocked sample rates.

 libselinux1 provides an API for SELinux applications to get and set
 process and file security contexts and to obtain security policy
 decisions.  Required for any applications that use the SELinux
 API. libselinux may use the shared libsepol to manipulate the binary
 policy if necessary (e.g. to downgrade the policy format to an older

Description: lightweight RDF syntax library
 Serd is a lightweight C library for RDF syntax which supports reading
 and writing Turtle and NTriples.
 .
 Serd is not intended to be a swiss-army knife of RDF syntax, but rather
 is suited to resource limited applications, or situations where a simple
 reader/writer with minimal dependencies is ideal (e.g. in LV2 hosts or
 plugins).
 .
 Serd is:
  * small: Serd is implemented in under 2500 lines1 of standard C code.
  * portable and dependency-free: Serd uses only the C standard library,
    and has no external dependencies, making it a lightweight dependency
    in every sense.
  * fast and lightweight: Serd (and the included serdi tool) can be used
    to stream abbreviated Turtle (unlike many other tools which can not
    stream since they must first build an internal model to abbreviate).
    In other words, Serd can re-serialise an unbounded amount of Turtle
    using a fixed amount of memory, preserving the abbreviations in the
    input.
  * conformant and well-tested: Serd is written to the Turtle, NTriples
    and URI specifications, and includes a comprehensive test suite which
    includes all the normative examples from the Turtle specification, all
    the "normal" examples from the URI specification, and additional tests
    added specifically for Serd. The test suite has over 96% code coverage

 For instance, compared to the fastest mode of zlib, Snappy
 is an order of magnitude faster for most inputs, but the resulting
 compressed files are anywhere from 20% to 100% bigger. On a single core
 of a Core i7 processor in 64-bit mode, Snappy compresses at about 250
 MB/sec or more and decompresses at about 500 MB/sec or more.

 libsoup uses the Glib main loop and is designed to work well with GTK+
 applications.  This enables GNOME applications to access HTTP servers
 on the network in a completely asynchronous fashion, very similar to
 the GTK+ programming model (a synchronous operation mode is also
 supported for those who want it).
 .
 The GNOME support library is used for features which are important to
 GNOME apps, but which require GNOME-specific libraries that non-GNOME
 apps may not want to add dependencies on.
 .
 Features:
  * Both asynchronous (GMainLoop and callback-based) and synchronous APIs
  * Automatically caches connections
  * SSL Support using GnuTLS
  * Proxy support, including authentication and SSL tunneling
  * Client support for Digest, NTLM, and Basic authentication

Description: Spiffy Perl Interface Framework For You
 "Spiffy" is a framework and methodology for doing object oriented (OO)
 programming in Perl. Spiffy combines the best parts of Exporter.pm,
 base.pm, mixin.pm and SUPER.pm into one magic foundation class. It
 attempts to fix all the nits and warts of traditional Perl OO, in a
 clean, straightforward and (perhaps someday) standard way.
 .
 Spiffy borrows ideas from other OO languages like Python, Ruby,
 Java and Perl 6. It also adds a few tricks of its own.
 .
 If you take a look on CPAN, there are a ton of OO related modules. When
 starting a new project, you need to pick the set of modules that makes
 most sense, and then you need to use those modules in each of your
 classes. Spiffy, on the other hand, has everything you'll probably need
 in one module, and you only need to use it once in one of your classes.
 If you make Spiffy.pm the base class of the basest class in your
 project, Spiffy will automatically pass all of its magic to all of your
 subclasses. You may eventually forget that you're even using it!

 read them back again. This is particularly useful for saving plugin
 state, or implementing plugin control with network transparency.
 Sratom uses Serd and Sord to do the work, it is a small library
 implemented in a single source file, suitable for direct inclusion
 in projects if avoiding a dependency is desired.

Description: Snowball stemming algorithms for use in Information Retrieval
 Snowball provides access to efficient algorithms for calculating a
 "stemmed" form of a word.  This is a form with most of the common
 morphological endings removed; hopefully representing a common
 linguistic base form.  This is most useful in building search engines
 and information retrieval software; for example, a search with stemming
 enabled should be able to find a document containing "cycling" given the
 query "cycles".
 .
 Snowball provides algorithms for several (mainly European) languages.
 It also provides access to the classic Porter stemming algorithm for
 English: although this has been superseded by an improved algorithm, the
 original algorithm may be of interest to information retrieval
 researchers wishing to reproduce results of earlier experiments.

Description: sophisticated exporter for custom-built routines
 When you use a perl module, first it is "required" function used, then its
 import method is called.
 .
 Sub::Exporter provides a sophisticated alternative to Exporter.pm.  It allows
 for renaming, currying/sub-generation etc.
 .
 Sub::Exporter builds a custom exporter which can then be installed into your
 module. It builds this method based on configuration passed to its
 setup_exporter method.

Description: module for using Sub::Exporter only if needed
 Sub::Exporter is an incredibly powerful module, but with that power comes
 great responsibility, as well as some runtime penalties.
 Sub::Exporter::Progressive is a Sub::Exporter wrapper that will let your
 users just use Exporter if all they are doing is picking exports, but use
 Sub::Exporter if your users try to use Sub::Exporter's more advanced
 features, like renaming exports.
 .
 Note that this module will export @EXPORT and @EXPORT_OK package variables
 for Exporter to work. Additionally, if your package uses advanced
 Sub::Exporter features like currying, this module will only use
 Sub::Exporter, so you might as well use it directly.

Description: module to retrieve names of code references
 Sub::Identify allows you to retrieve the real name of code references. For
 this, it uses perl's introspection mechanism, provided by the B module.
 .
 It provides four functions : sub_name returns the name of the
 subroutine (or __ANON__ if it's an anonymous code reference),
 stash_name returns its package, and sub_fullname returns the
 concatenation of the two.
 .
 The fourth function, get_code_info, returns a list of two elements,
 the package and the subroutine name (in case of you want both and are worried
 by the speed.)
 .
 In case of subroutine aliasing, those functions always return the
 original name.

 value is the sub.
 .
 The name is only used for informative routines (caller, Carp, etc).

Description: Direct solution of large, sparse systems of linear equations
 SuperLU is a general purpose library for the direct solution of
 large, sparse, nonsymmetric systems of linear equations on high
 performance machines.
 .
 The library is written in C and is callable from either C or Fortran.
 The library routines will perform an LU decomposition with partial
 pivoting and triangular system solves through forward and back
 substitution. The LU factorization routines can handle non-square
 matrices but the triangular solves are performed only for square
 matrices. The matrix columns may be preordered (before factorization)
 either through library or user supplied routines. This preordering
 for sparsity is completely separate from the factorization. Working
 precision iterative refinement subroutines are provided for improved
 backward stability. Routines are also provided to equilibrate the
 system, estimate the condition number, calculate the relative
 backward error, and estimate error bounds for the refined solutions.
 .
 This package contains the SuperLU shared library.

Description: FFmpeg library for audio resampling, rematrixing etc. - runtime files
 FFmpeg is the leading multimedia framework, able to decode, encode, transcode,
 mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much anything that humans and
 machines have created. It supports the most obscure ancient formats up to the
 cutting edge.
 .
 This library performs highly optimized audio resampling, rematrixing
 and sample format conversion operations.
 Specifically, this library performs the following conversions:
  * Resampling is the process of changing the audio rate, for example from a
    high sample rate of 44100Hz to 8000Hz. Audio conversion from high to low
    sample rate is a lossy process. Several resampling options and algorithms
    are available.
  * Rematrixing is the process of changing the channel layout, for example from
    stereo to mono. When the input channels cannot be mapped to the output
    streams, the process is lossy, since it involves different gain factors
    and mixing. Various other audio conversions (e.g. stretching and padding)
    are enabled through dedicated options.
  * Format conversion is the process of converting the type of samples, for
    example from 16-bit signed samples to unsigned 8-bit or float samples.
    It also handles packing conversion, when passing from packed layout (all
    samples belonging to distinct channels interleaved in the same buffer), to
    planar layout (all samples belonging to the same channel stored in a
    dedicated buffer or "plane").
 .

 FFmpeg is the leading multimedia framework, able to decode, encode, transcode,

 .
 This library performs highly optimized image scaling and colorspace and pixel
 format conversion operations.
 Specifically, this library performs the following conversions:
  * Rescaling is the process of changing the video size. Several rescaling
    options and algorithms are available. This is usually a lossy process.
  * Pixel format conversion is the process of converting the image format and
    colorspace of the image, for example from planar YUV420P to RGB24 packed.
    It also handles packing conversion, that is converts from packed layout
    (all pixels belonging to distinct planes interleaved in the same buffer),
    to planar layout (all samples belonging to the same plane stored in a
    dedicated buffer or "plane"). This is usually a lossy process in case the
    source and destination colorspaces differ.

 unlike the bonding driver, libteam (user space) has the following
 additional features:
  * load-balancing for LACP support
  * NS/NA (IPV6) link monitoring
  * port priorities and stickiness ("primary" option enhancement)
  * separate per-port link monitoring setup

Description: module providing minimalistic try/catch
 Try::Tiny is a Perl module that provides bare bones try/catch statements. It
 is designed to eliminate common mistakes with eval blocks, and NOTHING else.
 .
 The main focus of this module is to provide simple and reliable error
 handling for those having a hard time installing TryCatch, but who still want
 to write correct eval blocks without 5 lines of boilerplate each time.

Description: library for forensics analysis on volume and filesystem data
 The Sleuth Kit, also known as TSK, is a collection of UNIX-based command
 line file and volume system forensic analysis tools. The filesystem tools
 allow you to examine filesystems of a suspect computer in a non-intrusive
 fashion. Because the tools do not rely on the operating system to process the
 filesystems, deleted and hidden content is shown.
 .
 The volume system (media management) tools allow you to examine the layout of
 disks and other media. You can also recover deleted files, get information
 stored in slack spaces, examine filesystems journal, see partitions layout on
 disks or images etc. But is very important clarify that the TSK acts over the
 current filesystem only.
 .
 The Sleuth Kit supports DOS partitions, BSD partitions (disk labels), Mac
 partitions, Sun slices (Volume Table of Contents), and GPT disks. With these
 tools, you can identify where partitions are located and extract them so that
 they can be analyzed with filesystem analysis tools.
 .
 Currently, TSK supports several filesystems, as NTFS, FAT, exFAT, HFS+, Ext3,
 Ext4, UFS and YAFFS2.
 .
 This package contains the library which can be used to implement all of the
 functionality of the command line tools into an application that needs to
 analyze data from a disk image.

 libv4l1 offers the (deprecated) v4l1 API on top of v4l2 devices, independent
 of the drivers for those devices supporting v4l1 compatibility (which many
 v4l2 drivers do not).

 Many applications can use VDPAU to accelerate portions of the video

 .
 Audio visualization is the process of making pretty moving images that

 player, making it difficult to share code. Libvisual allows applications
 to use existing visualization plugins written for the libvisual framework.

 This package provides the runtime libraries for libvisual. Libvisual is not
 very useful without visualization plugins, so it is highly recommended to

Description: utility libraries for X C Binding -- keysyms
 This package contains the library files needed to run software using
 libxcb-keysyms, providing standard X key constants and conversion to/from
 keycodes.
 .
 The xcb-util module provides a number of libraries which sit on top of
 libxcb, the core X protocol library, and some of the extension
 libraries. These experimental libraries provide convenience functions
 and interfaces which make the raw X protocol more usable. Some of the
 libraries also provide client-side code which is not strictly part of
 the X protocol but which have traditionally been provided by Xlib.

 Xcursor is a simple library designed to help locate and load cursors for the

 several sizes; the library automatically picks the best size.  When using
 images loaded from files, Xcursor prefers to use the Render extension's
 CreateCursor request for rendering cursors.  Where the Render extension is
 not supported, Xcursor maps the cursor image to a standard X cursor and uses
 the core X protocol CreateCursor request.
 .
 Preferred themes for cursors can be installed if desired, via
 xcursor-themes or other cursor-theme or icon-theme packages,
 configured with update-alternatives --config x-cursor-theme.

 generating, manipulating, and validating XML documents. Xerces-C++ is
 faithful to the XML 1.0 recommendation and associated standards (DOM
 1.0, DOM 2.0, SAX 1.0, SAX 2.0, Namespaces, XML Schema Part 1 and
 Part 2).  It also provides experimental implementations of XML 1.1
 and DOM Level 3.0.  The parser provides high performance, modularity,
 and scalability.

Description: Perl module for parsing XML files
 The XML::Parser module provides ways to parse XML documents.  It is built on
 top of XML::Parser::Expat, which is a lower level interface to James Clark's
 expat library. Each call to one of the parsing methods creates a new instance
 of XML::Parser::Expat which is then used to parse the document. Expat options
 may be provided when the XML::Parser object is created. These options are
 then passed on to the Expat object on each parse call. They can also be given
 as extra arguments to the parse methods, in which case they override options
 given at XML::Parser creation time.
 .
 The behavior of the parser is controlled either by Style and/or Handlers
 options, or by setHandlers method. These all provide mechanisms for
 XML::Parser to set the handlers needed by XML::Parser::Expat. If neither
 Style nor Handlers are specified, then parsing just checks the document for
 being well-formed.
 .
 When underlying handlers get called, they receive as their first parameter
 the Expat object, not the Parser object.

Description: Perl module for processing huge XML documents in tree mode
 The XML::Twig module provides a way to process XML documents.  It is built on
 top of XML::Parser.
 .
 The module offers a tree interface to the document, while allowing to
 output the parts of it that have been completely processed.
 .
 It allows minimal resource (CPU and memory) usage by building the
 tree only for the parts of the documents that need actual processing,
 through the use of the twig_roots and twig_print_outside_roots
 options.  The finish and finish_print methods also help to increase
 performance.
 .
 XML::Twig tries to make simple things easy so it tries its best to
 takes care of a lot of the (usually) annoying (but sometimes
 necessary) features that come with XML and XML::Parser.

Description: Perl module for writing XML documents
 XML::Writer is a helper module for Perl programs that write an XML
 document.  The module handles all escaping for attribute values and
 character data and constructs different types of markup, such as
 tags, comments, and processing instructions.
 .
 By default, the module performs several well-formedness checks to
 catch errors during output.  This behaviour can be extremely useful
 during development and debugging, but it can be turned off for
 production-grade code.
 .
 The module can operate either in regular mode in or Namespace
 processing mode.  In Namespace mode, the module will generate
 Namespace Declarations itself, and will perform additional checks on
 the output.
 .
 Additional support is available for a simplified data mode with no
 mixed content: newlines are automatically inserted around elements
 and elements can optionally be indented based as their nesting
 level.

Description: re-usable XPath engine for DOM-like trees
 XML::XPathEngine provides an XPath engine, that can be re-used by other
 module/classes that implement trees.
 .
 In order to use the XPath engine, nodes in the user module need to mimic
 DOM nodes. The degree of similarity between the user tree and a DOM dictates
 how much of the XPath features can be used. A module implementing all of the
 DOM should be able to use this module very easily (you might need to add
 the cmp method on nodes in order to get ordered result sets).
 .
 This module is derived from Matt Sergeant's XML::XPath.

Description: Vertical Blanking Interval decoder (VBI) - common files
 The vertical blanking interval (VBI) is an interval in a television signal
 that temporarily suspends transmission of the signal for the electron gun
 to move back up to the first line of the television screen to trace the
 next screen field.
 .
 The vertical blanking interval can be used to carry data, since anything
 sent during the VBI would naturally not be displayed; various test signals,
 closed captioning, and other digital data can be sent during this time
 period. These include information like closed-caption data, Teletext
 (primarily in Europe), and now Intercast and the ATVEC Internet television
 encodings.
 .
 The Zapping VBI library, in short ZVBI, provides functions to capture and
 decode VBI data. It is written in plain ANSI C with few dependencies on
 other tools and libraries, licensed under GPL. Some features:
   * Captures raw VBI samples from V4L, V4L2 and FreeBSD BKTR devices, sliced
     VBI data from Linux DVB devices;
   * Implements a VBI Proxy to share one VBI device between multiple
     applications;
   * Has a robust and versatile bit slicer which handles a wide range of data
     services;

Description: Vertical Blanking Interval decoder (VBI) - runtime files
 The vertical blanking interval (VBI) is an interval in a television signal
 that temporarily suspends transmission of the signal for the electron gun
 to move back up to the first line of the television screen to trace the
 next screen field.
 .
 The vertical blanking interval can be used to carry data, since anything
 sent during the VBI would naturally not be displayed; various test signals,
 closed captioning, and other digital data can be sent during this time
 period. These include information like closed-caption data, Teletext
 (primarily in Europe), and now Intercast and the ATVEC Internet television
 encodings.
 .
 The Zapping VBI library, in short ZVBI, provides functions to capture and
 decode VBI data. It is written in plain ANSI C with few dependencies on
 other tools and libraries, licensed under GPL. Some features:
   * Captures raw VBI samples from V4L, V4L2 and FreeBSD BKTR devices, sliced
     VBI data from Linux DVB devices;
   * Implements a VBI Proxy to share one VBI device between multiple
     applications;
   * Has a robust and versatile bit slicer which handles a wide range of data
     services;
   * Functions to capture multiple data services at once, such as Closed
     Caption (both NTSC and PAL), Teletext, VPS, WSS, XDS;
   * Level 3.5 Teletext decoder with support for all Teletext character sets,

Description: Modular compiler and toolchain technologies
 LLVM is a collection of libraries and tools that make it easy to build
 compilers, optimizers, just-in-time code generators, and many other
 compiler-related programs.
 .
 LLVM uses a single, language-independent virtual instruction set both
 as an offline code representation (to communicate code between
 compiler phases and to run-time systems) and as the compiler internal
 representation (to analyze and transform programs). This persistent
 code representation allows a common set of sophisticated compiler
 techniques to be applied at compile-time, link-time, install-time,
 run-time, or "idle-time" (between program runs).
 .
 The strengths of the LLVM infrastructure are its extremely
 simple design (which makes it easy to understand and use),
 source-language independence, powerful mid-level optimizer, automated
 compiler debugging support, extensibility, and its stability and
 reliability. LLVM is currently being used to host a wide variety of
 academic research projects and commercial projects. LLVM includes C
 and C++ front-ends, a front-end for a Forth-like language (Stacker),
 a young scheme front-end, and Java support is in development. LLVM can
 generate code for X96, SparcV10, PowerPC or many other architectures.

Description: Linux Standard Base version reporting utility
 The Linux Standard Base (http://www.linuxbase.org/) is a standard
 core system that third-party applications written for Linux can
 depend upon.
 .
 The lsb-release command is a simple tool to help identify the Linux
 distribution being used and its compliance with the Linux Standard Base.
 LSB conformance will not be reported unless the required metapackages are
 installed.
 .
 While it is intended for use by LSB packages, this command may also
 be useful for programmatically distinguishing between a pure Debian
 installation and derived distributions.

Description: LPeg library for the Lua language
 LPeg is a new pattern-matching library for Lua, based on Parsing Expression
 Grammars (PEGs). PEGs look similar to regular expressions or context-free
 grammars in Backus-Naur form (BNF) notation. PEGs make a good replacement for
 regular expressions, because they are strictly more powerful. For example, a
 regular expression inherently cannot find matched pairs of parentheses, because
 it is not recursive, but a PEG can.

Description: utility for manipulating the MAC address of network interfaces
 GNU MAC Changer is an utility that makes the maniputation of MAC addresses of
 network interfaces easier.  MAC addresses are unique identifiers on networks,
 they only need to be unique, they can be changed on most network hardware.
 MAC addresses have started to be abused by unscrupulous marketing firms,
 government agencies, and others to provide an easy way to track a computer
 across multiple networks.  By changing the MAC address regularly, this kind
 of tracking can be thwarted, or at least made a lot more difficult.
 .
 Features:
 .
   * set specific MAC address of a network interface
   * set the MAC randomly
   * set a MAC of another vendor
   * set another MAC of the same vendor
   * set a MAC of the same kind (eg: wireless card)
   * display a vendor MAC list (today, 6200 items) to choose from

Description: recover files by looking for magic bytes
 Magic Rescue scans a block device for file types it knows how to recover
 and calls an external program to extract them. It looks at "magic bytes"
 (file patterns) in file contents, so it can be used both as an undelete
 utility and for recovering a corrupted drive or partition. As long as
 the file data is there, it will find it.
 .
 Magic Rescue uses files called 'recipes'. These files have strings and
 commands to identify and extract data from devices or forensics images.
 So, you can write your own recipes. Currently, there are the following
 recipes: avi, canon-cr2, elf, flac, gpl, gzip, jpeg-exif, jpeg-jfif,
 mbox, mbox-mozilla-inbox, mbox-mozilla-sent, mp3-id3v1, mp3-id3v2,
 msoffice, nikon-raw, perl, png, ppm, sqlite and zip.
 .
 This package provides magicrescue, dupemap and magicsort commands.
 magicrescue is a carver and is useful in forensics investigations.

Description: automatic mail-processing tool and filter
 Mailagent is a mail delivery agent, and can be programmed to
 respond to mail in ways more sophisticated than a mail filtering
 program like procmail. It is easy to configure, and very easy to
 extend using Perl. Not only can the base functionality be
 extended, new commands and processing methods can be added in a
 modular fashion.
 .
 Obeying lex-like rulesets, mailagent can file mails to specific
 folders (plain Unix-style folders and also MMDF and MH ones),
 forward messages to third parties, pipe them to commands or post
 them to newsgroups. The filtering commands that are executed on
 the messages can be extended, and may rewrite the message headers
 or body as desired. It can also create and process commands based
 on key words contained in the body of the mail message.
 .
 Mailagent can be used as a vacation program, and can answer mail
 automatically and with more flexibility than the command of that
 name. A template can be provided for the body of the response,
 and the frequency of vacation mails can also be specified. Simple
 macro substitutions allow parts of the mail header to be recycled
 into the vacation messages, for a more personalized reply.
 .
 Mailagent can also be used to set up a generic mail server,
 without the hassle of the lower-level concerns like error
 recovery, logging or command parsing.
 .
 Please note that on Debian systems, mailagent requires a catch-all
 rule saving all mail into the user's home directory. Unlike other
 Mail Delivery Agents such as procmail, mailagent is too extensible
 to be safely made setgid mail, and so cannot lock /var/spool/mail
 mailboxes.

 The mailcap system associates media types with programs that can handle them,
 using system and user configuration files.  A file's media type is determined
 by its extension or by running the "file" command if available.
 .
 Other packages register their programs as viewers/editors/composers/etc by
 placing mailcap entry files or FreeDesktop menu entries in predetermined
 directories monitored by this package's dpkg triggers.
 .
 This package provides a "run-mailcap" program to open arbitrary files, and in
 addition the "see", "edit", "compose", and "print" aliases to display, alter,
 create, and print (respectively).
 .
 This package also provides the "debian-view" utility to handle Debian packages

 GNU Make is a utility which controls the generation of executables

 need to be (re)created, and issues the commands to (re)create
 them. Make can be used to organize any task in which targets (files)
 are to be automatically updated based on input files whenever the
 corresponding input is newer --- it is not limited to building
 computer programs. Indeed, Make is a general purpose dependency
 solver.

 by applications should provide enough of an obstacle to prevent users easily or

Description: high-performance word generator with a per-position configurable charset
 Maskprocessor is a fast word list generator. It enumerates all combinations
 from a given user-defined keyspace and outputs the results. Since it supports
 different alphabets (which also can be combined) at different positions in the
 generation template ('mask'), this approach allows a more fine-tunable
 generation of candidates than using 'naive' brute force enumeration of words.
 Masks are defined using the description also used in the Hashcat password
 recovery utility.

Description: Pattern scanning and text processing language
 Mawk is an interpreter for the AWK Programming Language. The AWK
 language is useful for manipulation of data files, text retrieval and

 is a new awk meaning it implements the AWK language as defined in Aho,
 Kernighan and Weinberger, The AWK Programming Language, Addison-Wesley
 Publishing, 1988. (Hereafter referred to as the AWK book.) Mawk conforms
 to the POSIX 1003.2 (draft 11.3) definition of the AWK language
 which contains a few features not described in the AWK book, and mawk
 provides a small number of extensions.
 .
 Mawk is smaller and much faster than gawk. It has some compile-time
 limits such as NF = 32767 and sprintf buffer = 1020.

Description: fast, parallel, modular, login brute-forcer for network services
 Medusa is intended to be a speedy, massively parallel, modular, login
 brute-forcer. The goal is to support as many services which allow remote
 authentication as possible. The author considers following items as some of
 the key features of this application:
      * Thread-based parallel testing. Brute-force testing can be
        performed against multiple hosts, users or passwords
        concurrently.
      * Flexible user input. Target information (host/user/password) can
        be specified in a variety of ways. For example, each item can be
        either a single entry or a file containing multiple entries.
        Additionally, a combination file format allows the user to
        refine their target listing.
      * Modular design. Each service module exists as an
        independent .mod file. This means that no modifications are
        necessary to the core application in order to extend the
        supported list of services for brute-forcing.

Description: Netcat for the 21st century
 Ncat is a feature-packed networking utility which reads and writes data across
 networks from the command line. Ncat was written for the Nmap Project as a
 much-improved reimplementation of the venerable Netcat. It uses both TCP and
 UDP for communication and is designed to be a reliable back-end tool to
 instantly provide network connectivity to other applications and users. Ncat
 will not only work with IPv4 and IPv6 but provides the user with a virtually
 limitless number of potential uses.
 .
 Among Ncat’s vast number of features there is the ability to chain Ncats
 together, redirect both TCP and UDP ports to other sites, SSL support, and
 proxy connections via SOCKS4 or HTTP (CONNECT method) proxies (with optional
 proxy authentication as well). Some general principles apply to most
 applications and thus give you the capability of instantly adding networking
 support to software that would normally never support it.

Description: High-speed network authentication cracking tool
 Ncrack is a high-speed network authentication cracking tool.
 It was built to help companies secure their networks by
 proactively testing all their hosts and networking devices
 for poor passwords. Security professionals also rely on
 Ncrack when auditing their clients. Ncrack was designed
 using a modular approach, a command-line syntax similar to
 Nmap and a dynamic engine that can adapt its behaviour
 based on network feedback. It allows for rapid, yet
 reliable large-scale auditing of multiple hosts.
 .
 Ncrack's features include a very flexible interface granting
 the user full control of network operations, allowing for
 very sophisticated bruteforcing attacks, timing templates
 for ease of use, runtime interaction similar to Nmap's and
 many more. Protocols supported include RDP, SSH, http(s),
 SMB, pop3(s), VNC, FTP, and telnet.
 .
 Be sure to read the Ncrack man page (https://nmap.org/ncrack/man.html)
 to fully understand Ncrack usage.

   * black-box protocol auditing - whenever there are two or more
     proprietary boxes communicating using some undocumented protocol.
     By enforcing changes in ongoing transmissions, you will be able
     to test if the examined application can be claimed secure;
   * fuzz generating experiments, integrity tests - whenever you do
     stability tests of an application to see how it cares for data
     integrity;
   * other common use-cases: deceptive transfers, content filtering,
     protocol conversion - whatever best fits your task at hand.
 .
 It ideally complements a tool suite based on ngrep, netcat, and tcpdump.

 .
  * netsniff-ng: a zero-copy packet analyzer, pcap capturing/replaying tool
  * trafgen: a multithreaded low-level zero-copy network packet generator
  * mausezahn: high-level packet generator for appliances with Cisco-CLI
  * ifpps: a top-like kernel networking and system statistics tool
  * curvetun: a lightweight curve25519-based multiuser IP tunnel
  * astraceroute: an autonomous system trace route and DPI testing utility

 scanning techniques, version detection (determine service protocols
 and application versions listening behind ports), and TCP/IP
 fingerprinting (remote host OS or device identification). Nmap also
 offers flexible target and port specification, decoy/stealth scanning,
 sunRPC scanning, and more. Most Unix and Windows platforms are
 supported in both GUI and commandline modes. Several popular handheld
 devices are also supported, including the Sharp Zaurus and the iPAQ.
 .
 This package contains the nmap files shared by all architectures.

     - reading SIP can be omitted by providing the RTP port
     numbers, sothat any RTP traffic can be fuzzed
     - RTCP traffic can be suppressed to avoid that codecs
     - learn about the "noisy line"
     - special care is taken to break RTP handling itself
     - the RTP payload is fuzzed with a constant BER
     - the BER is configurable
     - requires arpspoof from dsniff to do the MITM attack
     - requires both phones to be in a switched LAN (GW
     operation only works partially)

Description: Smart card utilities with support for PKCS#15 compatible cards
 OpenSC provides a set of libraries and utilities to access smart
 cards.  It mainly focuses on cards that support cryptographic
 operations. It facilitates their use in security applications such as
 mail encryption, authentication, and digital signature. OpenSC
 implements the PKCS#11 API. Applications supporting this API, such as
 Iceweasel and Icedove, can use it. OpenSC implements the PKCS#15
 standard and aims to be compatible with all software that does so as
 well.
 .
 Before purchasing any cards, please read carefully documentation in
 https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/wiki - only some cards are
 supported. Not only does card type matters, but also card version,
 card OS version and preloaded applet. Only a subset of possible
 operations may be supported for your card. Card initialization may
 require third party proprietary software.
 .
 This package contains tools for interacting with smart cards.

Description: secure shell (SSH) client, for secure access to remote machines
 This is the portable version of OpenSSH, a free implementation of
 the Secure Shell protocol as specified by the IETF secsh working
 group.
 .
 Ssh (Secure Shell) is a program for logging into a remote machine
 and for executing commands on a remote machine.
 It provides secure encrypted communications between two untrusted
 hosts over an insecure network. X11 connections and arbitrary TCP/IP
 ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.
 It can be used to provide applications with a secure communication
 channel.
 .
 This package provides the ssh, scp and sftp clients, the ssh-agent
 and ssh-add programs to make public key authentication more convenient,
 and the ssh-keygen, ssh-keyscan, ssh-copy-id and ssh-argv0 utilities.
 .
 In some countries it may be illegal to use any encryption at all
 without a special permit.
 .
 ssh replaces the insecure rsh, rcp and rlogin programs, which are
 obsolete for most purposes.

Description: virtual private network daemon
 OpenVPN is an application to securely tunnel IP networks over a
 single UDP or TCP port. It can be used to access remote sites, make
 secure point-to-point connections, enhance wireless security, etc.
 .
 OpenVPN uses all of the encryption, authentication, and certification
 features provided by the OpenSSL library (any cipher, key size, or
 HMAC digest).
 .
 OpenVPN may use static, pre-shared keys or TLS-based dynamic key exchange. It
 also supports VPNs with dynamic endpoints (DHCP or dial-up clients), tunnels
 over NAT or connection-oriented stateful firewalls (such as Linux's iptables).

 Orca defines a set of default behaviors (reactions to application events) and
 key bindings (reaction to user key presses). These default behaviors and key
 bindings can be overwritten on a per-application basis. Orca creates a script
 object for each running application, which merges both the default behaviors
 and key bindings, and the application specific ones. Orca provides the
 infrastructure to activate and deactivate scripts, as well as a host of
 services accessible from within the scripts.

 Parted currently supports DOS, Mac, Sun, BSD, GPT, MIPS, and PC98
 partitioning formats, as well as a "loop" (raw disk) type which
 allows use on RAID/LVM. It can detect and remove ASFS/AFFS/APFS,
 Btrfs, ext2/3/4, FAT16/32, HFS, JFS, linux-swap, UFS, XFS, and ZFS
 file systems. Parted also has the ability to create and modify file
 systems of some of these types, but using it to perform file system
 operations is now deprecated.
 .
 The nature of this software means that any bugs could cause massive
 data loss. While there are no such bugs known at the moment, they
 could exist, so please back up all important files before running
 it, and do so at your own risk.

Description: PulseAudio Volume Control
 PulseAudio Volume Control (pavucontrol) is a simple GTK+ based volume
 control tool (mixer) for the PulseAudio sound server. In contrast to
 classic mixer tools this one allows you to control both the volume of
 hardware devices and of each playback stream separately. It also allows
 you to redirect a playback stream to another output device without
 interrupting playback.

Description: Larry Wall's Practical Extraction and Report Language
 Perl is a highly capable, feature-rich programming language with over
 20 years of development. Perl 5 runs on over 100 platforms from
 portables to mainframes. Perl is suitable for both rapid prototyping
 and large scale development projects.
 .
 Perl 5 supports many programming styles, including procedural,
 functional, and object-oriented. In addition to this, it is supported
 by an ever-growing collection of reusable modules which accelerate
 development. Some of these modules include Web frameworks, database
 integration, networking protocols, and encryption. Perl provides
 interfaces to C and C++ for custom extension development.

Description: version compatibility baseline for Perl OpenSSL packages
 A subset of Perl XS module packages expose the OpenSSL binary interface
 to Perl code. This can lead to incompatibilities if these packages are

 corresponds to the libssl-dev package SONAME it was built against.
 The packages that need to stay compatible with each other can depend
 on this.

Description: curses-based PIN or pass-phrase entry dialog for GnuPG
 This package contains a program that allows for secure entry of PINs or
 pass phrases.  That means it tries to take care that the entered
 information is not swapped to disk or temporarily stored anywhere.
 This functionality is particularly useful for entering pass phrases
 when using encryption software such as GnuPG or e-mail clients using
 the same.  It uses an open protocol and is therefore not tied to
 particular software.
 .
 The program contained in this package implements a PIN entry dialog
 using the curses tool kit, meaning that it is useful for users
 working in text mode without the X Window System.  There are sibling
 packages that implement PIN entry dialogs that use an X tool kit.  If
 you install any of the graphical packages then this package is not
 necessary because the sibling packages automatically fall back to
 text mode if X is not active.

Description: Tunnel TCP connections over ICMP packets
 ptunnel is an application that allows you to reliably tunnel TCP
 connections to a remote host using ICMP echo request and reply
 packets, commonly known as ping requests and replies. It acts as
 a proxy and can handle sockets and secured identification.
 .
 Those features can be very handy when working in a closed networking
 environment with firewalls and proxies.

Description: PulseAudio sound server
 PulseAudio, previously known as Polypaudio, is a sound server for POSIX and
 WIN32 systems. It is a drop in replacement for the ESD sound server with
 much better latency, mixing/re-sampling quality and overall architecture.
 .
 These are some of PulseAudio's features:
 .
   * High quality software mixing of multiple audio streams with support for
     more than one sink/source. May be used to combine multiple sound cards
     into one (with sample rate adjustment).
 .
   * Wide range of supported client libraries. ESD, ALSA, oss, libao and
     GStreamer client applications are supported as-is. Native PulseAudio
     plug-ins are also available for xmms and mplayer.
 .
   * Good low latency behaviour and very accurate latency measurement for
     playback and recording. Ability to fully synchronize multiple playback
     streams.
 .
   * Network transparency, allowing an application to play back or record
     audio on a different machine than the one it is running on.
 .
   * Extensible plug-in architecture with plug-ins for jackd, multicast-rtp
     lirc and avahi, just to name a few.
 .
 This package contains the daemon and basic module set.

Version: 1.2.2+dfsg-2
Description: matplotlib toolkit to plot on map projections (data package)
 The matplotlib basemap toolkit is a library for plotting 2D data on maps in
 Python. It is similar in functionality to the matlab mapping toolbox, the IDL
 mapping facilities, GrADS, or the Generic Mapping Tools. PyNGL and CDAT are
 other libraries that provide similar capabilities in Python.
 .
 Basemap does not do any plotting on its own, but provides the facilities to
 transform coordinates to one of 23 different map projections (using the PROJ.4
 C library). Matplotlib is then used to plot contours, images, vectors, lines or
 points in the transformed coordinates. Shoreline, river and political boundary
 datasets (from Generic Mapping Tools) are provided, along with methods for
 plotting them. The GEOS library is used internally to clip the coastline and
 political boundary features to the desired map projection region.
 .
 Basemap provides facilities for reading data in netCDF and Shapefile formats,
 as well as directly over http using OPeNDAP. This functionality is provided
 through the PyDAP client, and a Python interface to the Shapefile C library.
 .
 Basemap is geared toward the needs of earth scientists, particular
 oceanographers and meteorologists. The author originally wrote Basemap to help
 in his research (climate and weather forecasting), since at the time CDAT was
 the only other tool in Python for plotting data on map projections. Over the
 years, the capabilities of Basemap have evolved as scientists in other
 disciplines (such as biology, geology and geophysics) requested and contributed
 new features.

Version: 3.6.1-5
Description: hierarchical database for Python based on HDF5 - test data
 PyTables is a package for managing hierarchical datasets and designed
 to efficiently cope with extremely large amounts of data.
 .
 It is built on top of the HDF5 library and the NumPy package. It
 features an object-oriented interface that, combined with C extensions
 for the performance-critical parts of the code (generated using
 Cython), makes it a fast, yet extremely easy to use tool for
 interactively save and retrieve very large amounts of data. One
 important feature of PyTables is that it optimizes memory and disk
 resources so that they take much less space (between a factor 3 to 5,
 and more if the data is compressible) than other solutions, like for
 example, relational or object oriented databases.
 .
  - Compound types (records) can be used entirely from Python (i.e. it
    is not necessary to use C for taking advantage of them).
  - The tables are both enlargeable and compressible.
  - I/O is buffered, so you can get very fast I/O, specially with
    large tables.
  - Very easy to select data through the use of iterators over the
    rows in tables. Extended slicing is supported as well.
  - It supports the complete set of NumPy objects.
 .
 This package includes daya fils used for unit testing.

Description: Low-level CSS parser (test data)
 tinycss2 is a rewrite of tinycss with a simpler API, based on the more recent

 .
 tinycss2 is low-level in that it doesn’t parse all of CSS: it doesn't know
 about the syntax of any specific properties or at-rules. Instead, it provides a
 set of functions that can be composed to support exactly the parts of CSS
 you're interested in, including new or non-standard rules or properties,
 without modifying tinycss or having a complex hook/plugin system.
 .
 In many cases, parts of the parsed values (such as the content of a AtRule) is
 given as component values that can be parsed further with other functions.
 .
 This package contains the test data of the library.

   - a complete set of comparison methods,
   - an initializer,
   - and much more
 without writing dull boilerplate code again and again.

 Bleach is intended for sanitizing text from untrusted sources. If you find
 yourself jumping through hoops to allow your site administrators to do lots of
 things, you're probably outside the use cases. Either trust those users, or
 don't.

 Because it relies on html5lib, Bleach is as good as modern browsers at dealing
 with weird, quirky HTML fragments. And any of Bleach's methods will fix
 unbalanced or mis-nested tags.

Description: Python web development framework - Python 3 module
 CherryPy is a pythonic, object-oriented web development framework. It
 provides the foundation over which complex web-based applications can
 be written, with little or no knowledge of the underlying
 protocols. CherryPy allows developers to build web applications in
 much the same way they would build any other object-oriented Python
 program. This usually results in smaller source code developed in
 less time.
 .
 CherryPy is up-to-date with the latest developments on using Python
 for web development: it features a bundled WSGI server, and is able
 to integrate with other dispatching mechanisms, such as
 Routes. CherryPy can be run as a standalone application, since it
 provides its own HTTP server; setting it up behind another HTTP
 server, such as Apache, or even with mod_python are also options.

Description: simplify usage of Python decorators by programmers
 Python 2.4 decorators have significantly changed the way Python programs are
 structured.
    * decorators help reduce boilerplate code;
    * decorators help the separation of concerns;
    * decorators enhance readability and maintainability;
    * decorators are very explicit.
 Still, as of now, writing custom decorators correctly requires some
 experience and is not as easy as it could be. For instance, typical
 implementations of decorators involve nested functions and we all know that
 flat is better than nested.
 The aim of the decorator module it to simplify the usage of decorators for
 the average programmer and to popularize decorators usage giving examples of
 useful decorators, such as memoize, tracing, redirecting_stdout, locked, etc.

 Donut is a position-independent code that enables in-memory execution of
 VBScript, JScript, EXE, DLL files and dotNET assemblies. A module created by
 Donut can either be staged from a HTTP server or embedded directly in the
 loader itself. The module is optionally encrypted using the Chaskey block
 cipher and a 128-bit randomly generated key. After the file is loaded and
 executed in memory, the original reference is erased to deter memory scanners.
 The generator and loader support the following features:
    - Compression of input files with aPLib and LZNT1, Xpress, Xpress Huffman
      via RtlCompressBuffer.
    - Using entropy for API hashes and generation of strings.
    - 128-bit symmetric encryption of files.
    - Patching Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) and Windows Lockdown Policy
      (WLDP).
    - Patching command line for EXE files.
    - Patching exit-related API to avoid termination of host process.
    - Multiple output formats: C, Ruby, Python, PowerShell, Base64, C#,
      Hexadecimal.

  * Feature-rich, full implementation of the GPGME library. Supports
    all GPGME features except interactive editing (coming soon).
    Callback functions may be written in pure Python.

Description: Hamcrest framework for matcher objects (Python 3)
 PyHamcrest is a framework for writing matcher objects, allowing you to
 declaratively define "match" rules. There are a number of situations where
 matchers are invaluable, such as UI validation, or data filtering, but it is in
 the area of writing flexible tests that matchers are most commonly used. This
 tutorial shows you how to use PyHamcrest for unit testing.
 .
 When writing tests it is sometimes difficult to get the balance right between
 overspecifying the test (and making it brittle to changes), and not specifying
 enough (making the test less valuable since it continues to pass even when the
 thing being tested is broken). Having a tool that allows you to pick out
 precisely the aspect under test and describe the values it should have, to a
 controlled level of precision, helps greatly in writing tests that are
 "just right." Such tests fail when the behavior of the aspect under test
 deviates from the expected behavior, yet continue to pass when minor,
 unrelated changes to the behaviour are made.
 .
 This package provides the Python 3.x modules.

Description: Pythonic task execution - Python 3.x
 Invoke is a Python (2.6+ and 3.2+) task execution tool and library, drawing
 inspiration from various sources to arrive at a powerful and clean feature

 .
 Like Ruby's Rake tool and Invoke's own predecessor Fabric 1.x, it provides a
 clean, high level API for running shell commands and defining/organizing task
 functions from a tasks.py file.
 .
 From GNU Make, it inherits an emphasis on minimal boilerplate for common
 patterns and the ability to run multiple tasks in a single invocation.
 .
 Following the lead of most Unix CLI applications, it offers a traditional
 flag-based style of command-line parsing, deriving flag names and value types
 from task signatures.
 .
 Like many of its predecessors, it offers advanced features as well:
 namespacing, task aliasing, before/after hooks, parallel execution and more.

Description: small but fast and easy to use stand-alone template engine
 Jinja2 is a template engine written in pure Python. It provides a Django
 inspired non-XML syntax but supports inline expressions and an optional
 sandboxed environment.
 .
 The key-features are:
  * Configurable syntax. If you are generating LaTeX or other formats with
    Jinja2 you can change the delimiters to something that integrates better
    into the LaTeX markup.
  * Fast. While performance is not the primarily target of Jinja2 it’s
    surprisingly fast. The overhead compared to regular Python code was reduced
    to the very minimum.
  * Easy to debug. Jinja2 integrates directly into the Python traceback system
    which allows you to debug Jinja2 templates with regular Python debugging
    helpers.
  * Secure. It’s possible to evaluate untrusted template code if the optional
    sandbox is enabled. This allows Jinja2 to be used as templating language
    for applications where users may modify the template design.

Description: module for Mach-O header analysis and editing (Python 3 interface)
 This module can be used to analyze and edit Mach-O headers, the executable
 format used by Mac OS X.
 It's typically used as a dependency analysis tool, and also to rewrite dylib
 references in Mach-O headers to be @executable_path relative.
 Though this tool targets a platform specific file format, it is pure Python
 code that is platform and endian independent.
 .
 This package provides the Python 3.x module.

Description: fast and lightweight templating for the Python 3 platform
 Mako is a template library written in Python. It provides a familiar, non-XML
 syntax which compiles into Python modules for maximum performance. Mako's
 syntax and API borrows from the best ideas of many others, including Django
 templates, Cheetah, Myghty, and Genshi. Conceptually, Mako is an embedded
 Python (i.e. Python Server Page) language, which refines the familiar ideas of
 componentized layout and inheritance to produce one of the most
 straightforward and flexible models available, while also maintaining close
 ties to Python calling and scoping semantics.

Description: matplotlib toolkit to plot on map projections (Python 3)
 The matplotlib basemap toolkit is a library for plotting 2D data on maps in
 Python. It is similar in functionality to the matlab mapping toolbox, the IDL
 mapping facilities, GrADS, or the Generic Mapping Tools. PyNGL and CDAT are
 other libraries that provide similar capabilities in Python.
 .
 Basemap does not do any plotting on its own, but provides the facilities to
 transform coordinates to one of 23 different map projections (using the PROJ.4
 C library). Matplotlib is then used to plot contours, images, vectors, lines or
 points in the transformed coordinates. Shoreline, river and political boundary
 datasets (from Generic Mapping Tools) are provided, along with methods for
 plotting them. The GEOS library is used internally to clip the coastline and
 political boundary features to the desired map projection region.
 .
 Basemap provides facilities for reading data in netCDF and Shapefile formats,
 as well as directly over http using OPeNDAP. This functionality is provided
 through the PyDAP client, and a Python interface to the Shapefile C library.
 .
 Basemap is geared toward the needs of earth scientists, particular
 oceanographers and meteorologists. The author originally wrote Basemap to help
 in his research (climate and weather forecasting), since at the time CDAT was
 the only other tool in Python for plotting data on map projections. Over the
 years, the capabilities of Basemap have evolved as scientists in other
 disciplines (such as biology, geology and geophysics) requested and contributed
 new features.
 .
 This package contains the Python 3 version of python-mpltoolkits.basemap.

Description: Python3 API to manipulate OpenDocument files
 Odfpy is a library to read and write OpenDocument v. 1.1 files.
 The main focus has been to prevent the programmer from creating invalid
 documents. It has checks that raise an exception if the programmer adds
 an invalid element, adds an attribute unknown to the grammar, forgets to
 add a required attribute or adds text to an element that doesn't allow it.
 .
 These checks and the API itself were generated from the RelaxNG
 schema, and then hand-edited. Therefore the API is complete and can
 handle all ODF constructions.
 .
 In addition to the API, there are a few scripts:
 .
  - csv2ods - Create OpenDocument spreadsheet from comma separated values
  - mailodf - Email ODF file as HTML archive
  - odf2xhtml - Convert ODF to (X)HTML
  - odf2mht - Convert ODF to HTML archive

 analysis in Python. pandas is well suited for many different kinds of
 data:
 .
  - Tabular data with heterogeneously-typed columns, as in an SQL
    table or Excel spreadsheet
  - Ordered and unordered (not necessarily fixed-frequency) time
    series data.
  - Arbitrary matrix data (homogeneously typed or heterogeneous) with
    row and column labels
  - Any other form of observational / statistical data sets. The data
    actually need not be labeled at all to be placed into a pandas
    data structure

 "Paramiko" is a combination of the Esperanto words for "paranoid" and "friend".
 It's a module for Python 2.7/3.4+ that implements the SSH2 protocol for secure

 TLS), SSH2 protocol does not require hierarchical certificates signed by a
 powerful central authority. You may know SSH2 as the protocol that replaced
 Telnet and rsh for secure access to remote shells, but the protocol also
 includes the ability to open arbitrary channels to remote services across the
 encrypted tunnel (this is how SFTP works, for example).

Description: Python parser that supports error recovery - Python 3.X
 Parso is a Python parser that supports error recovery and round-trip parsing
 for different Python versions (in multiple Python versions). Parso is also able
 to list multiple syntax errors in your Python file.
 .
 Parso has been battle-tested by jedi. It was pulled out of jedi to be useful
 for other projects as well.
 .
 Parso consists of a small API to parse Python and analyse the syntax tree.
 .
 A simple example:
 .
  >>> import parso
  >>> module = parso.parse('hello + 1', version="3.6")
  >>> expr = module.children[0]
  >>> expr
  PythonNode(arith_expr, [<Name: hello@1,0>, <Operator: +>, <Number: 1>])
  >>> print(expr.get_code())
  hello + 1
  >>> name = expr.children[0]
  >>> name
  <Name: hello@1,0>
  >>> name.end_pos
  (1, 5)
  >>> expr.end_pos
  (1, 9)
 .
 To list multiple issues:
 .
  >>> grammar = parso.load_grammar()
  >>> module = grammar.parse('foo +\nbar\ncontinue')
  >>> error1, error2 = grammar.iter_errors(module)
  >>> error1.message
  'SyntaxError: invalid syntax'
  >>> error2.message
  "SyntaxError: 'continue' not properly in loop"

 All the basic PE file structures are available with their default names as
 attributes of the returned instance.
 .
 Processed elements such as the import table are made available with lowercase
 names, to differentiate them from the upper case basic structure names.
 .
 pefile has been tested against the limits of valid PE headers; that is,
 Windows malware. Lots of packed malware attempt to abuse the format beyond its
 standard use.
 .
 Some of the tasks that pefile makes possible are:
  * Modifying and writing back to the PE image
  * Header inspection
  * Section analysis
  * Retrieving data
  * Warnings for suspicious and malformed values
  * Packer detection with PEiD signatures

Description: File system based database that uses Python pickles for Python 3
 Like shelve, a PickleShareDB object acts like a normal dictionary. Unlike
 shelve, many processes can access the database simultaneously. Changing a
 value in database is immediately visible to other processes accessing the
 same database.
 .
 Concurrency is possible because the values are stored in separate files.
 Hence the "database" is a directory where all files are governed by
 PickleShare.
 .
 This package installs the library for Python 3.

  * It uses  LR-parsing which is reasonably efficient  and well suited
    for larger grammars.
  * PLY  provides most  of  the standard  lex/yacc features  including
    support for  empty productions, precedence  rules, error recovery,
    and support for ambiguous grammars.

Description: Python 3 bindings for protocol buffers
 Protocol buffers are a flexible, efficient, automated mechanism for
 serializing structured data - similar to XML, but smaller, faster, and
 simpler. You define how you want your data to be structured once, then you can
 use special generated source code to easily write and read your structured
 data to and from a variety of data streams and using a variety of languages.
 You can even update your data structure without breaking deployed programs
 that are compiled against the "old" format.
 .
 Google uses Protocol Buffers for almost all of its internal RPC protocols and
 file formats.
 .
 This package contains the Python 3 bindings for the protocol buffers. You will
 need the protoc tool (in the protobuf-compiler package) to compile your
 definition to Python classes, and then the modules in this package will allow
 you to use those classes in your programs.

Description: Python 3 module for PostgreSQL
 psycopg is a PostgreSQL database adapter for the Python3 programming language
 (just like pygresql and popy.) This is version 2, a complete rewrite of the
 original code to provide new-style classes for connection and cursor objects
 and other sweet candies. Like the original, psycopg 2 was written with the
 aim of being very small and fast, and stable as a rock.
 .
 psycopg is different from the other database adapter because it was designed
 for heavily multi-threaded applications that create and destroy lots of
 cursors and make a conspicuous number of concurrent INSERTs or UPDATEs.
 psycopg 2 also provides full asynchronous operations for the really brave
 programmer.
 .
 The main advantages of psycopg2 are that it supports the full Python DBAPI-2.0
 and being thread safe at level 2. It also includes some extensions to the
 standard DBAPI-2.0 to allow for better thread performance.

Description: cryptographic Python library (Python 3)
 PyCryptodome is a self-contained Python package of low-level
 cryptographic primitives.
 .
 PyCryptodome is a fork of PyCrypto. It brings several enhancements
 with respect to the last official version of PyCrypto (2.6.1),
 for instance:
 .
   * Authenticated encryption modes (GCM, CCM, EAX, SIV, OCB)
   * Accelerated AES on Intel platforms via AES-NI
   * Elliptic curves cryptography (NIST P-256, P-384 and P-521 curves only)
   * Better and more compact API (`nonce` and `iv` attributes for ciphers,
     automatic generation of random nonces and IVs, simplified CTR cipher mode,
     and more)
   * SHA-3 (including SHAKE and cSHAKE XOFs), truncated SHA-512 and BLAKE2
     hash algorithms
   * Salsa20 and ChaCha20/XChaCha20 stream ciphers
   * Poly1305 MAC
   * ChaCha20-Poly1305 and XChaCha20-Poly1305 authenticated ciphers
   * scrypt, bcrypt and HKDF derivation functions
   * Deterministic (EC)DSA
   * Password-protected PKCS#8 key containers
   * Shamir's Secret Sharing scheme
   * Random numbers get sourced directly from the OS (and not from a CSPRNG
     in userspace)
   * Cleaner RSA and DSA key generation (largely based on FIPS 186-4)
   * Major clean ups and simplification of the code base
 .
 PyCryptodome is not a wrapper to a separate C library like *OpenSSL*.
 To the largest possible extent, algorithms are implemented in pure Python.
 Only the pieces that are extremely critical to performance (e.g. block ciphers)
 are implemented as C extensions.
 .
 This is the Python 3 version of the package.

Description: Converts (packages) Python programs into stand-alone executables.
 PyInstaller is a program that converts (packages) Python programs into stand-
 alone executables, under Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris and AIX. Its main
 advantages over similar tools are that PyInstaller works with any version of
 Python since 2.3, it builds smaller executables thanks to transparent
 compression, it is fully multi-platform, and use the OS support to load the
 dynamic libraries, thus ensuring full compatibility.
 .
 The main goal of PyInstaller is to be compatible with 3rd-party packages out
 -of-the-box. This means that, with PyInstaller, all the required tricks to make
 external packages work are already integrated within PyInstaller itself so that
 there is no user intervention required. You'll never be required to look for
 tricks in wikis and apply custom modification to your files or your setup
 scripts. As an example, libraries like PyQt, Django or matplotlib are fully
 supported, without having to handle plugins or external data files manually.

 Rich is a Python library for rich text and beautiful formatting in the

 .
 The Rich API makes it easy to add color and style to terminal output. Rich can
 also render pretty tables, progress bars, markdown, syntax highlighted source
 code, tracebacks, and more — out of the box.
 .
 Here's a list of the core functionalities of rich:
 .
  * to effortlessly add rich output to your application, you can import the rich
    print method, which has the same signature as the builtin Python function
  * Rich can be installed in the Python REPL, so that any data structures will
    be pretty printed and highlighted
  * for more control over rich terminal content, import and construct a Console
    object. The Console object has a print method which has an intentionally
    similar interface to the builtin print function
  * to insert an emoji in to console output place the name between two colons
  * Rich can render flexible tables with unicode box characters. There is a
    large variety of formatting options for borders, styles, cell alignment etc
  * Rich can render multiple flicker-free progress bars to track long-running
    tasks.
  * Rich can render content in neat columns with equal or optimal width.
  * Rich can render markdown and does a reasonable job of translating the
    formatting to the terminal
  * Rich can render beautiful tracebacks which are easier to read and show more
    code than standard Python tracebacks. You can set Rich as the default
    traceback handler so all uncaught exceptions will be rendered by Rich.

Description: Pure Python Snowball stemming library
 Snowball provides access to efficient algorithms for calculating a
 "stemmed" form of a word.  This is a form with most of the common
 morphological endings removed; hopefully representing a common
 linguistic base form.  This is most useful in building search engines
 and information retrieval software; for example, a search with stemming
 enabled should be able to find a document containing "cycling" given the
 query "cycles".
 .
 Snowball provides algorithms for several (mainly European) languages.
 It also provides access to the classic Porter stemming algorithm for
 English: although this has been superseded by an improved algorithm, the
 original algorithm may be of interest to information retrieval
 researchers wishing to reproduce results of earlier experiments.
 .
 This package contains the pure Python module that implements Snowball
 algorithms. When python3-stemmer package (which contains the C extension)
 is installed, it uses that extension instead of the pure Python code.

Description: SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper for Python 3
 SQLAlchemy is an SQL database abstraction library for Python.
 Its strengths are:
  * full power and flexibility of SQL. SQLAlchemy provides a full suite
    of well known enterprise-level persistence patterns, designed for
    efficient and high-performing database access, adapted into a simple
    and Pythonic domain language.
  * extremely easy to use for all the basic tasks, such as: accessing pooled
    connections, constructing SQL from Python expressions, finding object
    instances, and committing object modifications back to the database.
  * powerful enough for complicated tasks, such as: eager load a graph of
    objects and their dependencies via joins; map recursive adjacency
    structures automatically; map objects to not just tables but to any
    arbitrary join or select statement; combine multiple tables together to
    load whole sets of otherwise unrelated objects from a single result set;
    commit entire graphs of object changes in one step.
  * built to conform to what DBAs demand, including the ability to swap out
    generated SQL with hand-optimized statements, full usage of bind parameters
    for all literal values, fully transactionalized and consistent updates
    using Unit of Work.
  * modular. Different parts of SQLAlchemy can be used independently of the
    rest, including the connection pool, SQL construction, and ORM. SQLAlchemy
    is constructed in an open style that allows plenty of customization, with
    an architecture that supports custom datatypes, custom SQL extensions, and
    ORM plugins which can augment or extend mapping functionality.

Description: SQLAlchemy type to store aware datetime values (Python 3)
 This package contains a drop-in replacement of SQLAlchemy's built-in DateTime
 type with timezone=True option enabled. Although SQLAlchemy's built-in
 DateTime type provides timezone=True option, since some vendors like SQLite
 and MySQL don't provide timestamptz data type, the option doesn't make any
 effect on these vendors.
 .
 UtcDateTime type is equivalent to the built-in DateTime with timezone=True
 option enabled on vendors that support timestamptz e.g. PostgreSQL, but on
 SQLite or MySQL, it shifts all datetime.datetime values to UTC offset before
 store them, and returns always aware datetime.datetime values through result
 sets.

Description: hierarchical database for Python3 based on HDF5
 PyTables is a package for managing hierarchical datasets and designed
 to efficiently cope with extremely large amounts of data.
 .
 It is built on top of the HDF5 library and the NumPy package. It
 features an object-oriented interface that, combined with C extensions
 for the performance-critical parts of the code (generated using
 Cython), makes it a fast, yet extremely easy to use tool for
 interactively save and retrieve very large amounts of data. One
 important feature of PyTables is that it optimizes memory and disk
 resources so that they take much less space (between a factor 3 to 5,
 and more if the data is compressible) than other solutions, like for
 example, relational or object oriented databases.
 .
  - Compound types (records) can be used entirely from Python (i.e. it
    is not necessary to use C for taking advantage of them).
  - The tables are both enlargeable and compressible.
  - I/O is buffered, so you can get very fast I/O, specially with
    large tables.
  - Very easy to select data through the use of iterators over the
    rows in tables. Extended slicing is supported as well.
  - It supports the complete set of NumPy objects.

 This package contains an implementation of the token bucket algorithm suitable

 implementation does not require the use of an independent timer thread to
 manage the bucket state.
 .
 Compared to other rate-limiting algorithms that use a simple counter, the token
 bucket algorithm provides the following advantages:
 .
 The thundering herd problem is avoided since bucket capacity is replenished
 gradually, rather than being immediately refilled at the beginning of each
 epoch as is common with simple fixed window counters.
 Burst duration can be explicitly controlled.
 .
 Moving window algorithms are resistant to bursting, but at the cost of
 additional processing and memory overhead vs. the token bucket algorithm which
 uses a simple, fast counter per key. The latter approach does allow for
 bursting, but only for a controlled duration.

 provisional basis and will no longer be provisional in Python 3.7. However,
 this means users of Python 3.5 - 3.6 who are unable to upgrade will not be
 able to take advantage of new types added to the typing module, such as
 typing.Text or typing.Coroutine.
 .
 The typing_extensions module contains both backports of these changes as well
 as experimental types that will eventually be added to the typing module, such
 as Protocol.
 .
 Users of other Python versions should continue to install and use the typing
 module from PyPI instead of using this one unless specifically writing code
 that must be compatible with multiple Python versions or requires experimental
 types.

Version: 1.3.2-1

Description: ASCII transliterations of Unicode text (Python 3 module)
 It often happens that you have text data in Unicode, but you need to represent
 it in ASCII for display. One could represent non-roman Unicode characters as
 "???" or "\\15BA\\15A0\\1610", but neither is useful to the user reading the
 text.
 .
 Unidecode tries to represent it in ASCII characters (i.e., the universally
 displayable characters between 0x00 and 0x7F), where the compromises taken
 when mapping between two character sets are chosen to be near what a human
 with a US keyboard would choose.
 .
 This module generally produces better results than simply stripping accents
 from characters (which can be done in Python with built-in functions). It is
 based on hand-tuned character mappings that for example also contain ASCII
 approximations for symbols and non-Latin alphabets.
 .
 unidecode is a Python 3 port of the Text::Unidecode Perl module.

Description: Python implementation of the WHATWG Encoding standard
 In order to be compatible with legacy web content when interpreting something

 example, US-ASCII and iso-8859-1 on the web are actually aliases for
 windows-1252, and an UTF-8 or UTF-16 BOM takes precedence over any other
 encoding declaration.  The Encoding standard defines all such details so that
 implementations do not have to reverse-engineer each other.

 implementation for encoders and decoders is Python’s.

Breaks: websockify (<< 0.8.0+dfsg1-14~)
Description: WebSockets support for any application/server - Python 3
 websockify was formerly named wsproxy and was part of the noVNC project.
 .
 At the most basic level, websockify just translates WebSockets traffic to
 normal socket traffic. Websockify accepts the WebSockets handshake, parses it,
 and then begins forwarding traffic between the client and the target in both
 directions.
 .
 Websockify supports all versions of the WebSockets protocol (Hixie and HyBi).
 The older Hixie versions of the protocol only support UTF-8 text payloads. In
 order to transport binary data over UTF-8 an encoding must used to encapsulate
 the data within UTF-8.
 .
 With Hixie clients, Websockify uses base64 to encode all traffic to and from
 the client. This does not affect the data between websockify and the server.
 .
 With HyBi clients, websockify negotiates whether to base64 encode traffic to
 and from the client via the subprotocol header (Sec-WebSocket-Protocol). The
 valid subprotocol values are 'binary' and 'base64' and if the client sends
 both then the server (the Python implementation) will prefer 'binary'. The
 'binary' subprotocol indicates that the data will be sent raw using binary
 WebSocket frames. Some HyBi clients (such as the Flash fallback and older
 Chrome and iOS versions) do not support binary data which is why the
 negotiation is necessary.
 .
 This package provides the Python 3 module.

  >>> from yarl import URL
  >>> url = URL('https://www.python.org/~guido?arg=1#frag')
  >>> url
  URL('https://www.python.org/~guido?arg=1#frag')
 .
 All URL parts: scheme, user, passsword, host, port, path, query and fragment
 are accessible by properties:
 .
  >>> url.scheme
  'https'
  >>> url.host
  'www.python.org'
  >>> url.path
  '/~guido'
  >>> url.query_string
  'arg=1'
  >>> url.query
  <MultiDictProxy('arg': '1')>
  >>> url.fragment
  'frag'
 .
 All URL manipulations produces a new URL object:
 .
  >>> url.parent / 'downloads/source'
  URL('https://www.python.org/downloads/source')
 .
 Strings passed to constructor and modification methods are automatically
 encoded giving canonical representation as result::
 .
  >>> url = URL('https://www.python.org/Ð¿ÑƒÑ‚ÑŒ')
  >>> url
  URL('https://www.python.org/%D0%BF%D1%83%D1%82%D1%8C')
 .
 Regular properties are percent-decoded, use `raw_` versions for getting
 encoded strings:
 .
  >>> url.path
  '/Ð¿ÑƒÑ‚ÑŒ'
 .
  >>> url.raw_path
  '/%D0%BF%D1%83%D1%82%D1%8C'
 .
 Human readable representation of URL is available as `.human_repr()`:
 .
  >>> url.human_repr()
  'https://www.python.org/Ð¿ÑƒÑ‚ÑŒ'

Description: hardware information-gathering tool for VESA PnP monitors
 read-edid consists of two tools:
 .
 get-edid uses a VESA VBE 2 interrupt service routine request to read
 a 128 byte EDID version 1 structure from your graphics card, which
 retrieves this information from the monitor via the Data Display
 Channel (DDC).
 .
 get-edid uses architecture-specific methods for querying the video
 hardware (real-mode x86 instructions on i386, Open Firmware device
 tree parsing on PowerMac) and is therefore only available for i386 and
 powerpc architectures.
 .
 parse-edid parses this data structure and outputs data suitable for
 inclusion into the XFree86 or X.org configuration file. It is available
 for any architecture.

Description: DNS rebinding tool
 Rebind is a tool that implements the multiple A record DNS
 rebinding attack. Although this tool was originally written
 to target home routers, it can be used to target any public
 (non RFC1918) IP address.
 .
 Rebind provides an external attacker access to a target
 router's internal Web interface. This tool works on routers
 that implement the weak end system model in their IP stack,
 have specifically configured firewall rules, and who bind
 their Web service to the router's WAN interface. Note that
 remote administration does not need to be enabled for this
 attack to work. All that is required is that a user inside
 the target network surf to a Web site that is controlled,
 or has been compromised, by the attacker.

 conducted quickly and thoroughly.
 .
 Recon-ng has a look and feel similar to the Metasploit Framework, reducing the
 learning curve for leveraging the framework. However, it is quite different.
 Recon-ng is not intended to compete with existing frameworks, as it is designed
 exclusively for web-based open source reconnaissance. If you want to exploit,
 use the Metasploit Framework. If you want to Social Engineer, use the Social
 Engineer Toolkit.

 tools for digital forensics investigations (though is useful for many
 purposes), and includes algorithms for retrieving deleted data structures
 from registry hives.
 .
 Currently the program allows one to read an entire registry and output it
 in a (mostly) standardized, quoted format. It also provides features for
 filtering of results based on registry path and data type. The package
 provides the following commands: reglookup, reglookup-recover and
 reglookup-timeline.

 RegRipper is an open source tool, written in Perl, for extracting/parsing
 information (keys, values, data) from the Registry and presenting it for
 analysis.
 .
 RegRipper consists of two basic tools, both of which provide similar
 capability. The RegRipper GUI allows the analyst to select a hive to parse, an
 output file for the results, and a profile (list of plugins) to run against the
 hive. When the analyst launches the tool against the hive, the results go to
 the file that the analyst designated. If the analyst chooses to parse the
 System hive, they might also choose to send the results to system.txt. The GUI
 tool
 will also create a log of it's activity in the same directory as the output
 file, using the same file name but using the .log extension (i.e., if the
 output is written to system.txt, the log will be written to system.log).

 Rifiuti2 can extract file deletion time, original path and size of deleted
 files and whether the deleted files have been moved out from the recycle
 bin since they are trashed.
 .
 Rifiuti2 is a rewrite of rifiuti, which is originally written for identical
 purpose. Then it was extended to cover more functionalities, such as:
 .
   * Handles recycle bin up to Windows 10;
   * Handles ancient Windows like 95, NT4 and ME;
   * Supports all localized versions of Windows - both Unicode-based ones
     and legacy ones (using ANSI code page);
   * Supports output in XML format as well as original tab-delimited text.
 .
 Rifiuti2 is designed to be portable and runs on command line environment. Two
 programs rifiuti and rifiuti-vista are chosen depending on relevant Windows
 recycle bin format.

Description: Ruby/EventMachine library
 EventMachine implements a fast, single-threaded engine for arbitrary network
 communications. It's extremely easy to use in Ruby. EventMachine wraps all
 interactions with IP sockets, allowing programs to concentrate on the
 implementation of network protocols. It can be used to create both network
 servers and clients. To create a server or client, a Ruby program only needs
 to specify the IP address and port, and provide a Module that implements the
 communications protocol. Implementations of several standard network protocols
 are provided with the package, primarily to serve as examples. The real goal
 of EventMachine is to enable programs to easily interface with other programs
 using TCP/IP, especially if custom protocols are required.

Description: Ruby library providing a selector API for monitoring IO objects
 nio4r (New IO for Ruby) provides an abstract, cross-platform stateful
 I/O selector API for Ruby. I/O selectors are the heart of
 "reactor"-based event loops, and monitor multiple I/O objects for
 various types of readiness, e.g. ready for reading or writing.
 .
 The most similar API provided by Ruby today is Kernel.select, however
 the select API requires you to pass in arrays of all of the I/O
 objects you're interested in every time. nio4r provides a more
 object-oriented API that lets you register I/O objects with a selector
 then handle them when they're selected for various types of events.
 .
 nio4r is modeled after the Java NIO API, but simplified for
 ease-of-use.
 .
 Its goals are:
 .
  * Expose high-level interfaces for stateful IO selectors.
  * Keep the API small to maximize both portability and performance across
    many different OSes and Ruby VMs.
  * Provide inherently thread-safe facilities for working with IO objects.

 The ruptime command gives a status line like uptime for each machine on the
 local network; these are formed from packets broadcast by each host on the
 network once a minute.

 /etc/rygel.conf 5e88250e5285ba33577ea702ba0ca51b
Description: GNOME UPnP/DLNA services
 Rygel is a home media solution that allows you to easily share audio, video
 and pictures, and control of media player on your home network. In technical
 terms it is both a UPnP AV MediaServer and MediaRenderer implemented through
 a plug-in mechanism. Interoperability with other devices in the market is
 achieved by conformance to very strict requirements of DLNA and on the fly
 conversion of media to format that client devices are capable of handling.
 .
 This package contains the core of Rygel and following plugins:
   * media-export: Recursively exports folders and files specified in the
     user configuration. This plugin supports all types of URIs that
     gio/gvfs and GStreamer can handle.
   * external: A MediaServer plugin that exports media hierarchies
     provided by external applications.
   * mpris: Export of media players that implement MPRIS2 D-Bus interface,
     as MediaRenderer devices.

Installed-Size: 98
Maintainer: Debian Security Tools <team+pkg-security@tracker.debian.org>
Architecture: amd64
Version: 1.7-6
Depends: libc6 (>= 2.15)
Description: data recovery tool for problematic or damaged media
 Safecopy tries to get as much data from SOURCE as possible, even resorting
 to device specific low level operations if applicable. This is achieved by
 identifying problematic or damaged areas, skipping over them and continuing
 reading afterwards. The corresponding area in the destination file is either
 skipped (on initial creation that means padded with zeros) or deliberately
 filled with a recognizable pattern to later find affected files on a corrupted
 device. The work is similar to ddrescue, generating an image of the original
 media. This media can be floppy disks, harddisk partitions, CDs, DVDs, tape
 devices, where other tools like dd would fail due to I/O errors.
 .
 Safecopy uses an incremental algorithm to identify the exact beginning and
 end of bad areas, allowing the user to trade minimum accesses to bad areas
 for thorough data resurrection.
 .
 Multiple passes over the same file are possible, to first retrieve as much
 data from a device as possible with minimum harm, and then trying to retrieve
 some of the remaining data with increasingly aggressive read attempts.
 .
 Safecopy includes a low level I/O layer to read CDROM disks in raw mode,
 and issue device resets and other helpful low level operations on a number
 of other device classes.
 .
 Safecopy is useful in forensics investigations and disaster recovery.

Description: tools for forensics analysis on volume and filesystem data
 The Sleuth Kit, also known as TSK, is a collection of UNIX-based command
 line file and volume system forensic analysis tools. The filesystem tools
 allow you to examine filesystems of a suspect computer in a non-intrusive
 fashion. Because the tools do not rely on the operating system to process the
 filesystems, deleted and hidden content is shown.
 .
 The volume system (media management) tools allow you to examine the layout of
 disks and other media. You can also recover deleted files, get information
 stored in slack spaces, examine filesystems journal, see partitions layout on
 disks or images etc. But is very important clarify that the TSK acts over the
 current filesystem only.
 .
 The Sleuth Kit supports DOS partitions, BSD partitions (disk labels), Mac
 partitions, Sun slices (Volume Table of Contents), and GPT disks. With these
 tools, you can identify where partitions are located and extract them so that
 they can be analyzed with filesystem analysis tools.
 .
 Currently, TSK supports several filesystems, as NTFS, FAT, exFAT, HFS+, Ext3,
 Ext4, UFS and YAFFS2.
 .
 This package contains the set of command line tools in The Sleuth Kit.

  - Create and compact database files
  - Create, define, modify and delete tables
  - Create, define and delete indexes
  - Browse, edit, add and delete records
  - Search records
  - Import and export records as text
  - Import and export tables from/to CSV files
  - Import and export databases from/to SQL dump files
  - Issue SQL queries and inspect the results
  - Examine a log of all SQL commands issued by the application
 .
 SQLite Database Browser is not a visual shell for the sqlite command line
 tool. It does not require familiarity with SQL commands.

 Block sizes greater than 4K are supported up to a maximum of 64K.
 .
 Squashfs is intended for general read-only filesystem use, for archival use
 (i.e. in cases where a .tar.gz file may be used), and in constrained block
 device/memory systems (e.g. embedded systems) where low overhead is needed.

 letter is following which letter based on the analysis of the original input
 dictionary used to generate the .hcstat. The resulting words can then, for
 example, be postprocessed and fed into Hashcat or other password recovery
 tools.

Description: Universal SSL tunnel for network daemons
 The stunnel program is designed to work  as  SSL  encryption
 wrapper between remote client and local (inetd-startable) or
 remote server. The concept is that having non-SSL aware daemons
 running  on  your  system you can easily setup them to
 communicate with clients over secure SSL channel.
 .
 stunnel can be used to add  SSL  functionality  to  commonly
 used  inetd  daemons  like  POP-2,  POP-3  and  IMAP servers
 without any changes in the programs' code.
 .
 This package contains a wrapper script for compatibility with stunnel 3.x

Description: Advanced version control system
 Apache Subversion, also known as svn, is a centralised version control
 system.  Version control systems allow many individuals (who may be
 distributed geographically) to collaborate on a set of files (source
 code, websites, etc).  Subversion began with a CVS paradigm and
 supports all the major features of CVS, but has evolved to support
 many features that CVS users often wish they had.
 .
 This package includes the Subversion client (svn, svnsync), repository
 administration tools (svnadmin, svnlook) and a network server (svnserve).

Description: multithreaded su bruteforcer
 sucrack is a multithreaded Linux/UNIX tool for cracking local
 user accounts via wordlist bruteforcing su. This tool comes in
 handy when you've gained access to a low-privilege user account
 but are allowed to su to other users. Many su implementations
 require a pseudo terminal to be attached in order to take the
 password from the user. This can't be easily achieved with a
 simple shell script. This tool, written in C, is highly
 efficient and can attempt multiple logins at the same time.

 X11 GUIs. An interpreted language provides branching and high-level control
 structures to direct the dialogue. In addition, the user can take control and
 interact directly when desired, afterward returning control to the script.

Suggests: tcpdump
Conflicts: tcpflow-nox
Description: TCP flow recorder
 tcpflow is a program that captures data transmitted as part of TCP
 connections (flows), and stores the data in a way that is convenient
 for protocol analysis or debugging. A program like 'tcpdump' shows a
 summary of packets seen on the wire, but usually doesn't store the
 data that's actually being transmitted. In contrast, tcpflow
 reconstructs the actual data streams and stores each flow in a
 separate file for later analysis.
 .
 tcpflow understands sequence numbers and will correctly reconstruct
 data streams regardless of retransmissions or out-of-order delivery.
 However, it currently does not understand IP fragments; flows
 containing IP fragments will not be recorded properly.
 .
 tcpflow is based on the LBL Packet Capture Library and therefore
 supports the same rich filtering expressions that programs like
 'tcpdump' support. tcpflow can also rebuild flows from data captured
 with 'tcpdump -w'.

 Tcpreplay is aimed at testing the performance of a NIDS by
 replaying real background network traffic in which to hide
 attacks. Tcpreplay allows you to control the speed at which the
 traffic is replayed, and can replay arbitrary tcpdump traces. Unlike
 programmatically-generated artificial traffic which doesn't
 exercise the application/protocol inspection that a NIDS performs,
 and doesn't reproduce the real-world anomalies that appear on
 production networks (asymmetric routes, traffic bursts/lulls,
 fragmentation, retransmissions, etc.), tcpreplay allows for exact
 replication of real traffic seen on real networks. It included the following
 executables tcpprep, tcprewrite, tcpreplay-edit, tcpbridge and pcap
 based captures are possible.

 The telnet command is used for interactive communication with another host

 .
 For the purpose of remote login, the present client executable should be
 depreciated in favour of an ssh-client, or in some cases with variants like
 telnet-ssl or Kerberized TELNET clients.  The most important reason is that
 this implementation exchanges user name and password in clear text.
 .
 On the other hand, the present program does satisfy common use cases of
 network diagnostics, like protocol testing of SMTP services, so it can
 become handy enough.

 VNC stands for Virtual Network Computing. It is, in essence, a remote
 display system which allows you to view a computing `desktop' environment
 not only on the machine where it is running, but from anywhere on the
 Internet and from a wide variety of machine architectures.
 .
 This package provides a server to which X clients can connect and the
 server generates a display that can be viewed with a vncviewer.
 .
 The difference between the tightvncserver and the normal vncserver is the
 data encoding, optimized for low bandwidth connections. If the client do not
 support jpeg or zlib encoding it can use the default one. Later versions of
 vncserver (> 3.3.3r2) support a new automatic encoding that should be equally
 good as the tightvnc encoding.
 .
 Note: This server does not support or need a display. You need a vncviewer to
 see something. However, this viewer may also be on a computer running other
 operating systems in the local net.

 scanner that is based on the openssl library, and on the
 "openssl s_client" command line tool. The current tests
 include checking if the target supports the SSLv2 protocol,
 the NULL cipher, weak ciphers based on their key length (40
 or 56 bits), the availability of strong ciphers (like AES),
 if the digital certificate is MD5 signed, and the current
 SSL/TLS renegotiation capabilities.

 tmux enables a number of terminals (or windows) to be accessed and
 controlled from a single terminal like screen. tmux runs as a
 server-client system. A server is created automatically when necessary
 and holds a number of sessions, each of which may have a number of
 windows linked to it. Any number of clients may connect to a session,
 or the server may be controlled by issuing commands with tmux.
 Communication takes place through a socket, by default placed in /tmp.
 Moreover tmux provides a consistent and well-documented command
 interface, with the same syntax whether used interactively, as a key
 binding, or from the shell. It offers a choice of vim or Emacs key
 layouts.

Description: Update Configuration File(s): preserve user changes to config files
 Debian policy mandates that user changes to configuration files must be
 preserved during package upgrades. The easy way to achieve this behavior
 is to make the configuration file a 'conffile', in which case dpkg
 handles the file specially during upgrades, prompting the user as
 needed.
 .
 This is appropriate only if it is possible to distribute a default
 version that will work for most installations, although some system
 administrators may choose to modify it. This implies that the
 default version will be part of the package distribution, and must
 not be modified by the maintainer scripts during installation (or at
 any other time).
 .
 This script attempts to provide conffile-like handling for files that
 may not be labelled conffiles, and are not shipped in a Debian package,
 but handled by the postinst instead. This script allows one to
 maintain files in /etc, preserving user changes and in general
 offering the same facilities while upgrading that dpkg normally
 provides for 'conffiles'.
 .
 Additionally, this script provides facilities for transitioning a
 file that had not been provided with conffile-like protection to come
 under this schema, and attempts to minimize questions asked at
 installation time. Indeed, the transitioning facility is better than the
 one offered by dpkg while transitioning a file from a non-conffile to
 conffile status.

 abilities include:
 .
    - Asynchronous stateless TCP scanning with all variations of TCP Flags.
    - Asynchronous stateless TCP banner grabbing
    - Asynchronous protocol specific UDP Scanning (sending enough of a signature
    to elicit a response).
    - Active and Passive remote OS, application, and component identification
    by analyzing responses.
    - PCAP file logging and filtering
    - Relational database output
    - Custom module support
    - Customized data-set views

 unprivileged users to escalate privileges to other users or
 to access local apps (e.g. databases).
 .
 It is written as a single shell script so it can be easily
 uploaded and run (as opposed to un-tarred, compiled and
 installed). It can run either as a normal user or as root
 (obviously it does a better job when running as root because
 it can read more files).

 This package contains integration scripts for configuring vlan

 For further details see vlan-interfaces(5) man page in this package.
 .
 Please note that these integration scripts only supports a limited
 set of interface naming schemes, which means you might be better
 off with writing your own ifupdown hooks using ip(route2)
 directly in /etc/network/interfaces rather than using this package.
 .
 It currently also ships a wrapper script for backwards compatibility
 called vconfig, that replaces the old deprecated vconfig program
 with translations to ip(route2) commands.
 This compatibility shim might be dropped in future releases, please
 use ip(route2) commands directly.
 .
 Your kernel needs vlan support for this to work, see "modinfo 8021q".

 Wapiti allows you to audit the security of your web applications.
 It performs "black-box" scans, i.e. it does not study the source code of the

 Once it gets this list, Wapiti acts like a fuzzer, injecting payloads to see
 if a script is vulnerable.
 .
 Wapiti can detect the following vulnerabilities:
  - Database Injection (PHP/ASP/JSP SQL Injections and XPath Injections)
  - Cross Site Scripting (XSS) reflected and permanent
  - File disclosure detection (local and remote include, require, fopen,
    readfile...)
  - Command Execution detection (eval(), system(), passtru()...)
  - XXE (Xml eXternal Entity) injection
  - CRLF Injection
  - Search for potentially dangerous files on the server (thank to the Nikto db)
  - Bypass of weak htaccess configurations
  - Search for copies (backup) of scripts on the server
  - Shellshock
  - DirBuster like
  - Server Side Request Forgery (through use of an external Wapiti website)

 home pages or to travel the web like a WWW robot.
 .
 Wget works particularly well with slow or unstable connections
 by continuing to retrieve a document until the document is fully
 downloaded. Re-getting files from where it left off works on
 servers (both HTTP and FTP) that support it. Both HTTP and FTP
 retrievals can be time stamped, so Wget can see if the remote
 file has changed since the last retrieval and automatically
 retrieve the new version if it has.
 .
 Wget supports proxy servers; this can lighten the network load,
 speed up retrieval, and provide access behind firewalls.

Description: Wi-Fi honeypot
 In the case of WPA/WPA2, by running airodump-ng along side
 this you also end up capturing the first two packets of
 the four way handshake and so can attempt to crack the key
 with either aircrack-ng or coWPAtty.
 .
 What this script does is to automate the setup process, it
 creates five monitor mode interfaces, four are used as APs
 and the fifth is used for airodump-ng. To make things
 easier, rather than having five windows all this is done in
 a screen session which allows you to switch between screens
 to see what is going on. All sessions are labelled so you
 know which is which.

 A number of terms are used to refer to the X Window System, including "X",
 "X Version 11", "X11", "X11R6", and "X11R7".  The version of X used in
 Debian is derived from the version released by the X.Org Foundation, and
 is thus often also referred to as "X.Org".  All of the preceding quoted
 terms are functionally interchangeable in an Debian system.

Description: X11 utilities
 An X client is a program that interfaces with an X server (almost always via
 the X libraries), and thus with some input and output hardware like a
 graphics card, monitor, keyboard, and pointing device (such as a mouse).
 .
 This package provides a miscellaneous assortment of X utilities
 that ship with the X Window System, including:
  - appres, editres, listres and viewres, which query the X resource database;
  - luit, a filter that can be run between an arbitrary application and a
    UTF-8 terminal emulator;
  - xdpyinfo, a display information utility for X;
  - xdriinfo, query configuration information of DRI drivers;
  - xev, an X event displayer;
  - xfd, a tool that displays all the glyphs in a given X font;
  - xfontsel, a tool for browsing and selecting X fonts;
  - xkill, a tool for terminating misbehaving X clients;
  - xlsatoms, which lists interned atoms defined on an X server;
  - xlsclients, which lists client applications running on an X display;
  - xlsfonts, a server font list displayer;
  - xmessage, a tool to display message or dialog boxes;
  - xprop, a property displayer for X;
  - xvinfo, an Xv extension information utility for X;
  - xwininfo, a window information utility for X;
 .
 The editres and viewres programs use bitmap images provided by the
 xbitmaps package. The luit program requires locale information from
 the libx11-data package.

 released.  The default behaviour is to generate the Escape key when Left
 Control is pressed and released on its own.

Description: filtering D-Bus proxy
 xdg-dbus-proxy is a filtering proxy for D-Bus connections. It was
 originally part of the Flatpak project, but it has been broken out as
 a standalone module to facilitate using it in other contexts, for
 example in WebKit-GTK's optional bubblewrap-based sandbox.
 .
 For this proxy to be useful, restricted D-Bus clients must be denied
 access to the normal D-Bus socket (for example by using containers or
 AppArmor rules), and instead given access to the listening Unix socket
 created by the proxy (typically by bind-mounting it into a Linux
 container).

Description: desktop integration portal for Flatpak and Snap
 xdg-desktop-portal provides a portal frontend service for Flatpak, Snap,
 and possibly other desktop containment/sandboxing frameworks. This service
 is made available to the sandboxed application, and provides mediated
 D-Bus interfaces for file access, URI opening, printing and similar
 desktop integration features.
 .
 The implementation of these interfaces is expected to require
 user confirmation before responding to the sandboxed application's
 requests. For example, when the sandboxed application ask to open a file,
 the portal implementation will open an "Open" dialog outside the sandbox,
 and will only make the selected file available to the sandboxed app if
 that dialog is confirmed.
 .
 xdg-desktop-portal is designed to be desktop-agnostic, and uses a
 desktop-environment-specific GUI backend such as xdg-desktop-portal-gtk
 to provide its functionality.

Description: tool to manage well known user directories
 xdg-user-dirs is a tool to help manage "well known" user directories
 like the desktop folder and the music folder. It also handles
 localization (i.e. translation) of the filenames.
 .
 The way it works is that xdg-user-dirs-update is run very early in the
 login phase. This program reads a configuration file, and a set of
 default directories. It then creates localized versions of these
 directories in the users home directory and sets up a config file in
 $(XDG_CONFIG_HOME)/user-dirs.dirs (XDG_CONFIG_HOME defaults to
 ~/.config) that applications can read to find these directories.

Description: Small utility to change the AccessX settings of XKEYBOARD
 AccessX is a set of features within the XKEYBOARD extension of the
 X Window System designed to make X more accessible to users with
 disabilities. XKEYBOARD is present in X11R6.1 and later. AccessX features
 are typically unknown, given that in many implementations no interface
 is provided to utilize their functionality.
 .
 Accessibility Features supported in AccessX include:
 .
  1. MouseKeys is a system whereby the numeric keypad can be used to control
     the mouse pointer.
 .
  2. SlowKeys is a feature to "slow down" keyboard input.
 .
  3. StickyKeys enables the user who is unable to press and hold multi-key
     combinations to enter them in a sequential format instead.
 .
  4. BounceKeys is similar to StickyKeys, except that instead of a delay
     affecting all keys pressed, the delay is only enabled for the key the
     user pressed last.
 .
  5. RepeatKeys sets the same parameters as the global repeat settings, but
     it is important to make note of it as an accessibility feature as well.

Description: Remote OS identification
 Xprobe2 allows you to determine what operating system is running on a
 remote host. It sends several packets to a host and analyses the
 returned answers.
 .
 Xprobe2's functionality is comparable to the OS fingerprinting feature
 in nmap (written by a different Fyodor):
  - Outputs its level of confidence about the OS on the remote host.
  - Remains usable even if intermediate systems (routers, firewalls) make
    slight modifications to the packets.
  - Can list the type of intermediate device (e.g. "Linux IP masquerading").
  - Modular architecture allows new fingerprinting tests and new OS
    signatures to be added.

Description: Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) server
 xrdp offers a graphical login to a remote client using
 RDP (the Remote Desktop Protocol). xrdp can connect to
 a locally created X.org session with the xorgxrdp drivers,
 to a VNC X11 server, and forward to another RDP server.
 .
 xrdp accepts connections from freerdp, rdesktop, and the
 built-in terminal server / remote desktop clients of
 Microsoft Windows operating systems.
 In the xorgxrdp (which replaces X11RDP) and VNC modes,
 it provides a fully functional Linux terminal server,
 offering an X-Window desktop to the user. In the RDP
 or VNC forwarding mode, any sort of desktop can be used.

Description: X terminal emulator
 xterm is a terminal emulator for the X Window System.  It provides DEC VT102
 and Tektronix 4014 compatible terminals for programs that cannot use the
 window system directly.  This version implements ISO/ANSI colors and most of
 the control sequences used by DEC VT220 terminals.
 .
 This package provides four commands: xterm, which is the traditional
 terminal emulator; uxterm, which is a wrapper around xterm that is
 intelligent about locale settings (especially those which use the UTF-8
 character encoding), but which requires the luit program from the x11-utils
 package; koi8rxterm, a wrapper similar to uxterm for locales that use the
 KOI8-R character set; and lxterm, a simple wrapper that chooses which of the
 previous commands to execute based on the user's locale settings.
 .
 A complete list of control sequences supported by the X terminal emulator
 is provided in /usr/share/doc/xterm.
 .
 The xterm program uses bitmap images provided by the xbitmaps package.
 .
 Those interested in using koi8rxterm will likely want to install the
 xfonts-cyrillic package as well.

Description: virtual network computing client software for X
 VNC stands for Virtual Network Computing. It is, in essence, a remote
 display system which allows you to view a computing `desktop' environment
 not only on the machine where it is running, but from anywhere on the
 Internet and from a wide variety of machine architectures.
 .
 It is implemented in a client/server model. This package provides a client
 for X, with this you can connect to a vncserver somewhere in the network
 and display its content in a window. There are vncserver available for other
 operating systems.
 .
 The difference between the xtightvncviewer and the normal vncviewer is the
 data encoding, optimized for low bandwidth connections. If the client do not
 support jpeg or zlib encoding it can use the default one. Later versions of
 xvncviewer (> 3.3.3r2) support a new automatic encoding that should be equally
 good as the tightvnc encoding.

Description: Virtual Framebuffer 'fake' X server
 Xvfb provides an X server that can run on machines with no display hardware
 and no physical input devices. It emulates a dumb framebuffer using virtual
 memory. The primary use of this server was intended to be server testing,
 but other novel uses for it have been found, including testing clients
 against unusual depths and screen configurations, doing batch processing with
 Xvfb as a background rendering engine, load testing, as an aid to porting the
 X server to a new platform, and providing an unobtrusive way to run
 applications that don't really need an X server but insist on having one
 anyway.
 .
 This package also contains a convenience script called xvfb-run which
 simplifies the automated execution of X clients in a virtual server
 environment. This convenience script requires the use of the xauth
 program.

Description: XZ-format compression utilities
 XZ is the successor to the Lempel-Ziv/Markov-chain Algorithm
 compression format, which provides memory-hungry but powerful
 compression (often better than bzip2) and fast, easy decompression.
 .
 This package provides the command line tools for working with XZ
 compression, including xz, unxz, xzcat, xzgrep, and so on. They can
 also handle the older LZMA format, and if invoked via appropriate
 symlinks will emulate the behavior of the commands in the lzma
 package.
 .
 The XZ format is similar to the older LZMA format but includes some
 improvements for general use:
 .
  * 'file' magic for detecting XZ files;
  * crc64 data integrity check;
  * limited random-access reading support;
  * improved support for multithreading (not used in xz-utils);
  * support for flushing the encoder.

Description: zero free blocks from ext2, ext3 and ext4 file-systems
 Zerofree finds the unallocated blocks with non-zero value content in
 an ext2, ext3 or ext4 file-system and fills them with zeroes
 (zerofree can also work with another value than zero). This is mostly
 useful if the device on which this file-system resides is a disk
 image. In this case, depending on the type of disk image, a secondary
 utility may be able to reduce the size of the disk image after
 zerofree has been run. Zerofree requires the file-system to be
 unmounted or mounted read-only.
 .
 The usual way to achieve the same result (zeroing the unused
 blocks) is to run "dd" to create a file full of zeroes that takes up
 the entire free space on the drive, and then delete this file. This
 has many disadvantages, which zerofree alleviates:
  * it is slow;
  * it makes the disk image (temporarily) grow to its maximal extent;
  * it (temporarily) uses all free space on the disk, so other
    concurrent write actions may fail.
 .
 Zerofree has been written to be run from GNU/Linux systems installed
 as guest OSes inside a virtual machine. If this is not your case, you
 almost certainly don't need this package. (One other use case would
 be to erase sensitive data a little bit more securely than with a
 simple "rm").
